Historically, Global Voices has been primarily supported by foundations and other grant-makers, and we’re grateful for the funding we receive that way. But sharp cuts to foreign aid by a number of governments are shrinking the available funds for nonprofits, with digital rights organizations like ours taking a particular hit. And it’s a hard time for news and translation organizations right now, with new technologies being used to cut staff and mass-produced disinformation crowding out quality news. Even in this challenging time, Global Voices’ production and readership have been going up, but since we are committed to never paywalling and not showing ads, that doesn’t translate into covering our running costs unless readers donate. Global Voices is a relatively low-cost organization to run: we have no office, no rent, and few physical supplies. We pay for the servers that host our site and a few other administrative costs, but by far the majority of our expenses are for paying our staff. Many grants don’t want to fund more than a small percentage of personnel costs, because they want to pay directly for activities, but personnel costs are the basis of all our activities. Our staff and our volunteers research stories, write and edit, translate and advocate — and sometimes they also do graphic design or photo choice, social media promotion, and more. That is who we’re trying to support with the funds from this campaign — our community, the people who make the articles and essays, translations, research reports, and podcasts that you find on our site. If we had a dollar for every page view of the site, we wouldn't need to do a campaign! And if each of those dollars were a monthly commitment, we’d be able to plan ahead for longer-term activities and be generally less stressed. But we know that not everyone can contribute for lots of different reasons, so instead we can think about it as five dollars from one-fifth of the monthly site visits, or ten dollars from one-tenth, and maybe someone who hasn't read anything this month but believes in what we do kicks in twenty-five bucks, and someone else who loves translations sends another fifteen and… you get the idea. We hope that you can be one of those contributors, and if you can’t right now, we hope you still come and spend time on our site, and then tell other people about it. Even more than a news site, Global Voices is a community, and we’d like you to be a part of it. We’ll be sharing about the campaign and about Global Voices on social media, so please repost so more people learn about us and how they can get involved. Thank you for your support! Donate",

    "text": "By Grecia Flores Hinostroza In Peru, women’s rights exist in a strange paradox: on paper, we have the laws, the representation, and the international commitments that promise equality; in reality, our lives tell a different story. Political progress coexists alongside persistent neglect, with numbers that flatter and figures that fail. This contradiction is not hidden in the shadows — the painful contrast is written plainly in the numbers we so proudly display. According to the SDG Gender Index, Peru scores 72.9 for “Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments,” a figure that suggests progress, visibility, and leadership. And yet, when we shift our gaze to health, the score drastically drops to 35.5, barely half. Women are present in Congress, but absent from the healthcare system that should protect them. If political participation alone were enough, our streets would be safer, our hospitals accessible, and our voices heard beyond the voting booth. But in Peru, as in much of Latin America, representation has not broken the chains of inequality — it has simply made them less visible to those who govern. The data tells one story. The lives of rural, Indigenous, and poor women tell another — one where access to basic sexual and reproductive health services is a distant reality. Where hospitals, experts, and care are unreachable. As the political scientist Stéphanie Rousseau notes in “The Politics of Reproductive Health in Peru,” “Although health sector reforms have had some positive impact on women’s reproductive health, the many restrictions placed on women’s right to reproductive choices have blocked further progress.” The consequences are not abstract. In 2020, Peru’s maternal mortality ratio stood at 69 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the World Health Organization, far above the Latin American average of 45 and nearly five times that of Chile (16) and Uruguay (13). These numbers represent women whose lives could have been saved by timely care, safe births and the fulfilment of rights already recognized by law. But these injustices are not only moral failures; they are legal betrayals. Peru has signed its name beneath international promises: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and others. These are not distant treaties gathering dust in diplomatic archives. They are binding commitments, written to safeguard the dignity, health, and safety of women — commitments meant to reach every hospital room, courtroom, and remote village in our country. Laws protecting sexual and reproductive health rights exist on paper, but they remain distant from the realities of rural, Indigenous, and poor women. Clinics lack essential services. Comprehensive reproductive care is unavailable. Legal frameworks declare equality, but equality disappears in places where women still face forced pregnancies, unsafe births, and systemic neglect. The Constitution speaks of equality, but equality does not walk the roads where women carry their pregnancies alone. The Ministry of Health issues protocols, but those protocols do not save lives when the nearest health centre is closed, or when the only doctor is gone. Rights without access are hollow. Commitments without implementation are betrayal. In this context, political representation must not be mistaken for liberation. We cannot accept the illusion of progress that comes from more women in office if it is not matched by concrete action to dismantle structural barriers. Empowerment is not an empty slogan — it is the lived reality without fear, accessing healthcare without barriers, and raising one’s voice without retaliation. The gap between law and life is not an abstract policy flaw; it is a daily crisis. It is the young girl in a rural province forced to give birth after sexual assault because abortion is inaccessible. It is the mother who dies on the way to a hospital that never has the capacity to treat her. Likewise, it is the Indigenous community where reproductive rights exist only in the language of faraway courts, not in the practice of local healthy systems. If we measure success only by the presence of women in power, we ignore the absence of justice in their communities. Numbers in parliament cannot compensate for empty maternity wards. International recognition cannot replace the right to safe childbirth. I call on the Peruvian Congress to legislate not for appearances, but for autonomy. To ensure that health, safety, and dignity are realities in every province. I call on international donors to fund the fight for reproductive freedom, not just political participation. And I call on Peruvian society to recognize that representation without rights is no victory at all. Representation matters. But it is only the beginning. Real empowerment is when every woman controls her future — her body, her health, her voice — regardless of where she was born or how far she lives from the capital. Until the day, the paradox will remain, and progress will be a promise half-kept.",

    "text": "This analysis by Nataša Stanojević was originally published by the International and Security Affairs Centre (ISAC), part of the regional initiative Western Balkans Anti-Disinformation Hub. An edited version is republished by Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement. The protest held on June 28 this year in Belgrade, on the Serbian national and religious holiday, Vidovdan, represented the culmination of months of public discontent with government policies and systemic societal problems. Vidovdan is deeply rooted in national history and collective memory and has often been used as a symbol of political and moral struggle. In this case, students and other citizens chose the date to underscore the seriousness of their demands for responsible governance, to call for snap elections, and advocate for essential institutional reforms. According to estimates, the protest gathered around 140,000 people, making it one of the largest political gatherings in the past decade. The sheer size of the turnout reflects profound social frustration and a sense that institutional mechanisms for expressing discontent have completely failed. However, while the organizers’ demands were clearly defined — fighting corruption, institutional accountability, and democratization of the system — pro-government media constructed an entirely different picture. Instead of fact-based reporting, the public sphere was flooded with sensationalist headlines and claims aimed at delegitimizing the protests and criminalizing participants. The student movement and citizens were not portrayed as advocates of democratic values, but as a threat to the stability of the state. This strategy of criminalization, typical of authoritarian regimes, allowed the authorities to justify the use of force and intensified repression. Pro-government media in Serbia systematically employ false and manipulative narratives to discredit legitimate civic protests and normalize the state’s repressive responses. Analysis shows that key propaganda tactics include labeling participants, manipulating events, constructing an image of a foreign enemy, and glorifying police force. These practices have long-term consequences for democratic processes and freedom of expression. Instruments of the propaganda narrative One of the most commonly used strategies was the deployment of pejorative labels. Organizers and participants were not referred to as students or citizens but as “blockaders,” “hooligans,” and “terrorists.” A headline in the tabloid newspaper Informer, “Anti-hooligan operation in the city center: Watch how blockaders are arrested,” illustrates how police intervention was presented as necessary and legitimate, while citizens were criminalized. The term “terrorists” carries particularly strong connotations, suggesting extremism, even though the protests were peaceful in nature. Media outlets widely circulated narratives about an alleged “hellish plan” by demonstrators. Headlines such as “Bridges and the entire city under siege: The new hellish plan of blockader terrorists, they want blood and dead bodies on the streets!” create an atmosphere of fear and suggest inevitable escalation into violence. These unfounded claims serve to mobilize the government’s loyal voter base and legitimize repressive measures. Rhetoric about “blood on the streets” and “danger to citizens” not only criminalizes protest participants but also frames them as a national security threat. Pro-government discourse attributed goals to the protesters, such as “destroying the state” and “overthrowing the president.” These claims are not based on any documents or public statements by organizers, whose demands focused on improving safety, fighting corruption, and ensuring political accountability. Introducing accusations of “treason” and “collaboration with enemies” is part of a broader model of political propaganda in which social resistance is portrayed as a conspiracy against national interests. While pro-government media insisted on an image of violent demonstrations, actual events tell a different story. According to reports from independent media and human rights organizations, the majority of the protest was peaceful. This was also confirmed by the Council of Europe. The few incidents that occurred happened only after police intervention, during which excessive force was used. The arrests or detentions of hundreds of people, along with documented cases of physical abuse, clearly show that state repression was the dominant dynamic. This gap between the media narrative and empirical facts is a classic example of the framing technique — selective presentation of reality to shape public opinion. The broader political context and the foreign enemy narrative Particularly concerning is the strategy of linking the protests to alleged foreign enemies, in this case, Croatia. Certain tabloids and politicians suggested that the organizers of the protests were instruments in the hands of Croatian intelligence structures and that their goal was the destabilization of Serbia. These claims have no factual basis, but serve a clear propaganda purpose: to evoke historical tensions and use national stereotypes to create a sense of threat among citizens. (The hostilities between Serbia and Croatia have deep roots in their national narratives. These tensions began during the Ottoman Empire when many Serbian refugees were settled in Croatia by the Austrian authorities. The animosity intensified during World War II when Croatia joined the Axis powers, and was solidified during the wars that accompanied Yugoslavia’s breakup. This period culminated in Operation Storm, which resulted in the majority of Serbs fleeing Croatia.) The use of Croatia in this narrative has a dual function: first, to mobilize patriotic sentiment; by suggesting that the protests are connected to a “hostile state,” the government reinforces its image as the defender of national interests. Second, it discredits the opposition and civic initiatives; by attributing “foreign influence” to the protests, the government delegitimizes their goals and diverts attention from internal problems such as corruption and institutional breakdown. This rhetoric relies on the well-known model of “constructing a foreign enemy,” which, according to political communication theory, serves to homogenize the electorate and justify authoritarian practices. A particularly alarming segment of the propaganda campaign concerns the linkage of protests with the issue of Srebrenica. (The 1995 massacre of the Muslim population in Srebrenica and its surrounding areas by the Army of Republika Srpska is frequently exploited by both nationalist and anti-Western factions in Serbia. Similar to narratives that deny the Holocaust, discussions about Srebrenica range from complete denial to unsettling debates about the number of victims, their nationality, and the use of terms like “necessary military action” and “collateral damage.” Over the past 15 years, anyone who does not support these narratives has been labeled a “traitor” or a “Western agent” in official political discourse.) In an Informer article entitled “They’ve exposed themselves! This is blockader politics: Accusing Serbia of a nonexistent genocide in Srebrenica,” students were accused of “agreeing with accusations that brand Serbs as a genocidal nation.” This narrative attempts to shift the focus from demands for democratization to a national question, creating the impression that the protests have an “anti-Serbian agenda.” In this way, civic resistance is criminalized through manipulation of one of the most emotionally charged issues in the public sphere. A similar rhetoric is used by the portal Vaseljenska in the article “Blockaders want to declare Serbs a genocidal nation: Elections, then a government that will recognize the genocide in Srebrenica.” These claims are absent from any official demands of the organizers, but their function is clear: to discredit the protests by linking them with alleged plans to “betray national interests.” Thus, the government constructs a narrative in which students are not only “hooligans” but also agents of dangerous ideological and political projects. Narrative vs objective facts In the long term, such practices lead to the consolidation of authoritarian patterns of governance. When every criticism of regime representatives is labeled as “treason” or “terrorism,” the space for democratic dialogue disappears. This not only delegitimizes protests but also undermines the fundamental values on which modern democratic societies rest. This analysis of the media narrative surrounding the Vidovdan protests demonstrates that pro-government media act as a propaganda apparatus whose primary function is the preservation of political power, not informing the public. Through the dissemination of a distorted perception of civic resistance, the construction of violent scenarios, and the invention of foreign enemies, the authorities succeed in delegitimizing valid social demands and justifying repressive measures. Such a strategy may stabilize the regime in the short term, but in the long run, it erodes the foundations of democracy and leads to further political and social crises.",

    "text": "This Dart Centre Asia Pacific Report by Arun Karki was originally published in Nepali Times, and an edited version has been republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement. What should a journalist do when young protesters are shot in front of her? Does she do her job and stay neutral? Can you stay neutral? As Gen Z protests engulfed Kathmandu, Nepal's journalists found themselves reporting a story that was personal. While doing their job, some of them were even targeted by mobs. Read More: Gen Z stands up to expose corruption in Nepal Dart Asia Pacific Fellow Arun Karki visited their newsrooms and spoke with his colleagues about their experience of reporting the Gen Z protests that erupted on September 8th. These are the first-hand accounts of journalists who witnessed the turmoil in the city they call home. Sunita Karki was at a workshop in a hotel on September 8th. She saw the first waves of protests through hotel windows. Curfew alerts flooded her phone, a vehicle belonging to a human rights group sat burning across the road, young boys were taking their wounded friends on motorbikes to local hospitals, and police were beating a teenager with their hands raised. “I cried a lot,” she said, but the tears were not out of fear — they were because she felt guilt. “I couldn’t write the news. We were witnessing these scenes from a five-star hotel.” By evening, the death toll had reached 19. On September 9th at about 3:35 pm, her outlet, the Annapurna Post's office in Tinkune, Kathmandu, was set on fire. Staff had to leave the building as parts of the newsroom burned down. When she knew her office was burning, she anxiously told her husband that she would resign from the job: “If we have to hide our identification cards in every protest, what kind of journalist am I?” she asked herself. She filed a story the next day, but her emotions kept bouncing between those of a journalist bound to duty and a civilian in shock. She said that in moments like this, it’s hard to feel truly neutral. After watching the police beat people, she felt a strong urge to step in, not just stand back and report. The first real calm came later, when people came to the street and lit candles together in honor of those who were killed. “This was a sort of victory procession. I felt some relief after brutal days,” she said. Angad Dhakal a photojournalist who works at Kantipur National Daily, was standing outside his office building when protesters stormed in and set parts of it on fire. He had already been informed that protesters were planning to torch his office building and rushed to his office hoping to save his hard drives containing ten years of photography work. He failed. He raised his camera and “forcefully” pressed the shutter — more to document the scene than out of “professional enthusiasm or duty.” “My office was burning. What should I photograph?” he recalled. A few moments later, a protester noticed the “PHOTO” label on his yellow Press jacket. Dhakal deflected it by saying he was an early-career freelancer and YouTuber. He went into a corner and took his jacket off so that protesters wouldn't target him. When it comes to covering street protests, Angad usually stands near the police because it feels safer. But on September 8th, fire and gunshots made even that area unsafe. A rubber bullet hit his friend Dipendra Dhungana, badly injuring him. He thought, “Where do we go now? If we stay here, we’ll be hit.” After witnessing two days of protests, violence, and killings, and seeing his own office burning, he couldn't sleep for days. The same afternoon that government buildings burned and media outlet Kantipur was attacked, a message in a protest Discord forum talked openly of “attacking Kantipur.” Rumors spread to other outlets. Outside OnlineKhabar's office, where Gaurav Pokharel works, the newsroom manager said, “Very suspicious people were walking around.” They lowered blinds, avoided windows, locked the front gate, and dispersed staff to other places across the city. The outlet was threatened and effectively locked down, but not torched. Pokharel hid his press ID. “ I never showed the ID card. Sometimes I had to enter the crowd shouting slogans, just to blend in among the protesters,” he said. He watched people fall under gunfire, and he helped pull one surrounded journalist out of a hostile crowd. Gaurav also contributed articles to international outlets as a freelancer. Later, while transcribing an interview of a young protest organizer, he wrote to his editor at an international outlet: “This was very hard to write. I cried many times while doing it.” He had been working at a stretch for days, battling bouts of exhaustion and low blood pressure. Protesters vandalized and set fire within the Singha Darbar complex housing Nepal Television and Radio Nepal. They tried to disrupt public broadcasting. Surendra Paudyal began the day with his press ID hanging on his neck, thinking it would let him move freely. But when he reached Singha Darbar around 3:30 pm, the situation felt dangerous. He put the ID in his pocket. When asked what mattered most, he answered without pause: life comes first. In that moment, he felt real fear and a strong duty to protect his team. His focus narrowed to basic things: stay calm, find exits, get everyone out safely. Later, they were able to keep the 8 pm news on air through a regional link. He felt mixed emotions and a sense of relief that the broadcast continued, but also sadness and anger that their own studio had come under attack.",

    "text": "By Bowel Diop Gender-based violence, including marital rape, occurs worldwide, and often, the perpetrators are the victim's husband. Marital rape is defined as an act in which one partner forces the other to engage in non-consensual sex. A report by Equality, a US-based organisation with offices in New York, Nairobi, and London, reveals that many women are affected by this phenomenon, including many in Africa. In private online forums where women post under anonymity, distressing testimonies emerge about the violence they suffer within relationships. Out of respect and for the protection of those sharing their stories, no names or platform details are revealed. Behind these testimonies emerges a chilling reality: that of sexual relations imposed within marriage without the woman’s consent, in other words, the reality of marital rape. As violence against women becomes increasingly common, consent is being trampled. The notion of “conjugal duty” still frequently outweighs a woman’s right to make decisions about her body. It is in these digital spaces, where distress is voiced and violence normalized, that discussion groups take shape, embodying a form of digital sisterhood. Providing room for listening, support, and open speech, these spaces enable women to challenge together the taboos that restrict their empowerment, online as well as offline. This safe space where women share their experiences underlines the urgency of an open and courageous debate on marital rape in Africa. A cultural, religious, and legal debate In May 2025, the program “Midi Plus” on TFM Télévision Futur Média, based in Senegal, gave national exposure to Oustaz Modou Fall, a Muslim authority in the country. This preacher claims that conjugal duty takes precedence over consent, thereby legitimizing sexual violence in the name of marriage. Speaking in Wolof, he stated: Gnouni loi bi néna sakh sa diabar so beugué teud akk mom té dacoroul daga ko violé . Pfff wakhi dof ! Sa diabar ga takk ko so farata Yallah akk souna Seydouna Mohamed , touki Pape Samba dem tournage soneu baye beugu dé gnibissi beugu teud ak sokhname gnouniko bouné dama soneu damadone fobéré (rires) ga forcéko viol le. Boudé lou amm la , lane moye texte bi. Si diné. People say the law declares that if you force your wife to have sex, that counts as rape. Pfff — absurd, this is your wife, the one you married before God. You travel, you work, Pape Samba [the host], you come back exhausted, you want to be with your wife, and she refuses. She says she’s tired, that she was doing the housework (laughter). So if you insist, it’s rape? If that’s the case, which religious scripture says so? We must be cautious about this. The broadcast immediately sparked indignation across social media. On TikTok, activists and legal experts mobilized. The Xam Sa Droit page published a series of videos challenging Modou Fall’s statements against existing legislation. Specifically, it points to Article 320 of Senegal’s Penal Code, which defines rape as any act of penetration “carried out through violence, coercion, threat or surprise.” This is a reminder that marriage does not take away any fundamental rights, and that refusing sex, even within a couple, remains an inalienable right. This effort at legal education was met with strong support on TikTok, as it put consent back at the center of the discussion. Voices were also raised on X. Nabou Diop Lo, a lawyer and activist for women’s and children’s rights, posted: Le viol tel que définit dans le code pénal Sénégalais ne fait pas une distinction entre le viol commis dans le ménage et celui commis hors des liens conjugaux. Tout ce qui compte c'est le consentement de la victime. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025 Rape, as defined in the Senegalese Penal Code, makes no distinction between rape committed within marriage and that committed outside it. What matters is the victim’s consent. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025 But how can a woman dare complain she's been raped when a religious figure claims that a wife’s “no” carries no weight? This dissonance between the law, public discourse, and women’s lived reality highlights the urgent need for legal reform and a clear stance from the authorities. By normalizing marital rape, this official rhetoric entrenches an absolute claim over women’s bodies and heavily compounds the moral weight borne by potential victims. Equality Now’s 2024 report shows that the legal recognition of marital rape differs significantly across Africa. The report notes that countries such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Madagascar, Senegal, and Togo explicitly criminalize marital rape. In countries including Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Tanzania, spouses are explicitly exempted from prosecution, except in exceptional cases. In Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mali, Uganda, and Chad, the law remains silent on the matter, creating a complete legal void. Senegalese law on rape and paedophilia, revised in 2020, sets out the definition of rape as follows: Tout acte de pénétration « commis par violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise ». Any act of penetration ‘committed by violence, coercion, threat, or surprise.’ However, the lack of clear legal provisions on marital rape and spousal consent creates a wide scope for interpretation, often to the detriment of the victim. As a result, marital rape is often treated as an ordinary form of domestic violence, rather than classified as a criminal offence. In Côte d’Ivoire, for example, an investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde published in February 2024 reported that a humorous TikTok video mocking women’s sexual fatigue sparked amused reactions — evidence that sexual non-consent is not taken seriously. According to figures published in African Health Sciences, 33 percent of women in Africa have been subjected to sexual violence at some point in their lives, with rates rising to 44 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Côte d’Ivoire, 40 percent of women housed in the shelter run by the NGO Akwaba Mousso say they have suffered marital rape. In many African legal systems, including in Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, the implicit presumption of consent between spouses prevents marital rape from being effectively recognised as a crime. When feminists raise awareness on the subject, the issue is frequently minimised. In the previously mentioned Le Monde article, Ivorian activist Marie-Paule Okri, co-founder of the Ivorian League for Women’s Rights, told the journalist: Quand on essaie d’en parler, on nous répond qu’on exagère. On nous inculque depuis l’adolescence que le corps de la femme est fait pour donner du plaisir à l’homme. When we try to talk about it, we are told we are exaggerating. From adolescence, we are taught that a woman’s body exists to give pleasure to men. Yet Article 14 of the Maputo Protocol commits African states to guaranteeing women’s fundamental rights, including health and reproductive consent. Beyond legislation, it will take a deep change in attitudes to improve women’s condition, grounded in respect for their bodies and equality in relationships.",

    "text": "On October 7, 2023, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), the group that governs the Palestinian territory of Gaza, breached the barrier that has surrounded the densely populated area for the last 16 years, preventing the free flow of people and goods. The militants then launched an attack on 22 nearby Israeli settlements, towns, and military bases, killing around 1,200 civilians and soldiers and taking at least 199 hostages. Many governments around the world have condemned the attack as a war crime and act of terror, while other governments blamed Israel for setting the stage for these attacks to take place. Since then, many governments have described Israel’s response as disproportionate: the official death toll now exceeds 40,000 Palestinians killed, including over 15,000 children — some experts estimate the actual number to be over four times higher. For more, read Global Voices’ previous Special Coverage: Israel’s war on Gaza The assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas Political Bureau, in Tehran on 31 July 2024, and a key Hezbollah military commander in Beirut on 30 July have significantly escalated tensions in the region. These targeted killings, combined with the failure to implement a ceasefire, are raising the risk of a war that could engulf the whole region, with potentially far-reaching consequences for global peace and stability. Israel’s actions, including its military occupation, settlement expansion, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and recurrent operations in Gaza and the West Bank, have drawn widespread accusations of human rights violations and defiance of international law. This includes an International Court of Justice (ICJ) initial ruling on an ongoing case finding it plausible that Israel is committing genocide and an application by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for arrest warrants against three Hamas leaders — including Haniyeh — and two Israeli officials — including Prime Minister Netanyahu — for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The arrest warrants include one for Mohammed Deif, Commander-in-Chief of Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. the Israeli army claims to have assassinated Deif in an airstrike on July 13 in the Al Mawasi humanitarian safe zone in Gaza — one that killed at least 90 people in a massacre described by United Nations official Scott Anderson as “some of the most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.” Israel's military operations and targeted assassinations in neighboring countries continue despite United Nations Security Council resolutions, global calls for a ceasefire, and repeated condemnations from international humanitarian organizations who have labeled them as violations of international humanitarian law. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached catastrophic levels, with an illegal blockade that has led to severe shortages of vital supplies and the threat of a poliovirus outbreak, exacerbating the suffering of the population, with nine out of 10 people internally displaced, many of them multiple times. The international community’s failure to enforce a ceasefire or hold Israel accountable has highlighted the limitations of global institutions in managing the crises. The United Nations has failed to mediate effectively, with its resolutions ignored, and global and regional players have not put pressure on Israel to accept or implement ceasefire resolutions adopted by the UNSC or proposed by mediators. This raises significant questions about the effectiveness of international law in protecting civilians in conflict zones. In this special coverage, we explore the regional and global implications as well as the challenges facing international law in addressing the ongoing crisis.",

    "text": "By Natalie Briggs When I first met Florence Warrick-Joseph, there were two things I didn’t know. One, we were related in that pumpkin vine way only Caribbean people can be. Two, the doubles I had just bought from her at a pop-up market had a surprise in them. It wasn’t the comforting warmth of a bara hot out of the box, leaking through greaseproof paper. It wasn’t the silken tear of teeth into that just-fried pillowy goodness, which, if you’re lucky, will still hold a hint of the crackle of oil. No, it wasn’t that. It was the filling. Cucumber, check. Sweet sauce, check. The heady bouquet of garlic, cumin and spices was there. But there was something different in the mouth feel. It wasn’t the melt-in-your-mouth consistency of the channa that makes doubles a national byword in Trinidad and Tobago. Tasty, yes … but different. The same bouquet is heavy in Warrick-Joseph’s small kitchen, tickling the nostrils, making me think about the last time I ate. “I don’t curry the peas. I stew it,” she revealed, while demonstrating how she puts her spin on the popular street food. This is not her only departure from the norm. The peas she uses? They are pigeon peas. These days, it isn’t quite the record scratch moment it was when it first appeared — but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. What we should be discussing is how pigeon peas, the stuff of pelau and coconut milk stew-downs, ended up in doubles. It started as an exhortation to think outside the box. In 2014, Warrick-Joseph, a retired registered nurse, decided to do an event management course. Her lecturer asked the cohort to stretch themselves beyond the ho-hummery of birthday parties and christenings for their practicum. She was an avid planter of pigeon peas, one of the many members of the Upper Cemetery Street Residents’ Association in Diego Martin, to do so. They had a bumper crop that year. “We were walking back down the hill,” Warrick-Joseph recalled. “Me, Errol [her husband] and Mr. Timothy. And he asked what were we going to do with all these peas. My husband said, ‘We will freeze it, we will sell it.’ Because that is what people do to get money to put in the organisation. So I said, thinking out of the box, we could have a pigeon peas festival.” The two men were sceptical. Warrick-Joseph continued, “They were like, ‘Nobody ever heard of a pigeon peas festival.’ I said, ‘I’ve heard of a mango festival. I’ve heard of a breadfruit festival. There’s a chocolate festival. Why not pigeon peas?’” The stage was set, but the main players were yet to arrive. They had the peas, but it would literally take a village to showcase their versatility. By the time the first festival rolled around in 2015, it was a result of a true community effort. They were able to generate so many recipes, including a version of doubles, that there were enough to fill a commemorative book. “We got someone to do pholourie,” Warrick-Joseph said. “We got somebody who could do pigeon peas accra. Everybody ended up taking a recipe. We found people in the community who could do these things. The pigeon peas roti was from a woman who did roti, and instead of using the dhal with the split peas, she used the pigeon peas.” Pholourie? Accra? Roti? It wasn’t such a stretch of the imagination. After all, pigeon peas’ nutty, earthy flavour lends itself well to a variety of savoury preparations. That’s why it’s a perennial favourite across the Caribbean. But Warrick-Joseph was about to hit me another curveball. That first festival, she came up with four of her own recipes. One for ice cream. One for a punch. One for a pigeon peas wine. Then one for a liqueur. Two of those are sweet. One of them officially qualifies as dessert. The trick was in picking, shelling and stewing the fresh pigeon peas to form the custard base all within 24 hours, while they were still full of flavour. My mind had more difficulty wrapping around the idea of pigeon peas as this creamy, cold concoction. There were no such problems with the muffins. As I stood and watched her prepare them, different scents filled the kitchen, this time with her signature spice blend. It was the spice, I realised, that gave it the illusion of being sweet. I hadn’t seen her put a lot of sugar into the mixture. The eventual result was dense, reminding me more of a coconut drop than the traditional muffin with its cakey crumb. Fresh out of the oven, breaking into one was a treat; I could smell the spices wafting up from the steamy centre. There was nutmeg. Some cinnamon, too. Nothing in the flavour screamed pigeon peas. That was more in the texture and the solidity with which it sat in my stomach. One muffin felt like a full meal, which led me to ask about the nutritional benefits of the pigeon peas substitution. I found out that, among other things, they were high in potassium and fibre, and were good for gut flora, diabetics, and women who wanted to lose weight. In fact, it was trying to cater to customers who wanted healthier alternatives to doubles that prompted Warrick-Joseph to come up with a recipe for gluten-free bara, made with pigeon pea flour: “The reason for the switch was that people felt they wanted gluten-free. There was a group of people that was intolerant to normal flour.” These were what I had really come to see her prepare, the muffins being a delectable side journey. I knew it would be different from the first doubles I had from her, since the bara in that one had been made the regular way, with flour, leavening agent and oil. How different this version would be, both in taste and feel, was left to be seen. It was a three-flour mix, including the ground pigeon peas, which resulted in a tacky, sticky sort of dough that was allowed to rest for about half an hour. While it did that, Warrick-Joseph warmed the oil in which she would fry them later, and prepared the pigeon peas filling. We talked about many things while she did this, including her business and her plans to eventually have pre-packaged products in the supermarket. When she deemed the dough ready, she put the peas aside. The low gluten content made it difficult to handle as it tears easily, which is why she prefers to use a pastelle press to shape them, instead of rolling them out the traditional way. From there, the perfect circles went into the warmed oil, where they puff up slightly — nothing like the regular bara, because of the low gluten content. By the time they are done, I’m itching to try them. Warrick-Joseph presented them to me on a plate, complete with pigeon peas filling, cucumber and a tangy tamarind sweet sauce. I took a bite, and chewed slowly, trying to make up my mind about them. The verdict? All the elements were there. This tasted like doubles. Purists might draw the line at the bara, which was more reminiscent of a soft taco shell — flatter, with a slight, mealy crunch to it — while health enthusiasts might hail it as the thing to make doubles great again.",

    "text": "Exile Hub is one of Global Voices’ partners in Southeast Asia, emerging in response to the 2021 coup in Myanmar, focusing on empowering journalists and human rights defenders. This edited article is republished under a content partnership agreement. Most people spend their lives running away from danger. Esther ran toward it. After finding refuge in Australia under UNHCR protection, she made the bold decision to return to the Thailand–Myanmar border in 2023 to continue her journalism. Now, in 2025, she reports from one of Myanmar’s most dangerous conflict zones often under fire, often uncertain of tomorrow. Yet she remains unshaken. In a world where silence is safe, Esther chooses the frontline. Her weapon is truth, and she wields it for those who cannot. A journey against the current Born in Mon State in 1993, Esther has always been someone who could not ignore injustice. “I have never been able to lie to myself or live in misery. If something doesn’t sit right with me, I have to face it head-on,” she reflects. Like many young people in Myanmar, Esther initially wandered through different jobs, unsure of her calling. She translated movies, worked as a travel and tour sales representative, and later became a public relations officer at a Korean company. But none of these roles felt right. “I couldn’t stay where I felt trapped or compromised,” she shares. Her turning point came in 2018 when she attended a basic journalism course. “That’s when I realized writing and sharing opinions was what I had always loved. It felt like home.” After the course ended, she landed her first journalism job at an ethnic media house. When the coup changed everything By 2021, Esther was working with a major media house. When the coup hit, her newsroom relocated to Karenni State, and Esther went with them, continuing to report under dangerous conditions. But even after escaping to Australia for safety, the pull of truth was stronger than comfort. In 2023, she made the decision to return. A few months after she arrived in Thailand, the military made a desperate announcement. In February 2024, the military reactivated its conscription law, mandating that men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 serve in the army. Evading service or helping someone evade could lead to five years in prison. “As the number of these conscription stories grew, so did my determination to report them,” Esther recalls. But working as an exiled independent journalist came with its own struggles. With no regular income and the constant need for resources, continuing her work was a challenge. That’s when she applied for Exile Hub’s Critical Voices Fellowship 2024 and received it. Bearing witness on the frontlines Esther began collecting stories from those most affected. She spoke with young men who had fled their villages, fearful of being conscripted. She also interviewed women who had watched brothers and husbands taken by the army, leaving families uncertain and anxious about their loved ones’ fate. In September 2024, she published “I Don’t Want Others to Face What I Faced: Stories of Forced Military Conscription,” giving a voice to those the regime wanted silenced. Later, she followed with another hard-hitting piece, “Snatched from Their Beds, Taken on the Streets — The Young Men in Myanmar Forced to Fight the Junta’s Losing War.” Today, Esther works deep inside one of Myanmar’s most volatile conflict zones, a place where the sound of gunfire and the threat of airstrikes are constant. Despite the risks, she is satisfied with witnessing the truth with her eyes and documenting and reporting on it. Esther is more than a journalist. She is a lifeline for those whose cries would otherwise vanish in the dark. And no matter the risk, she will keep writing and keep reporting, because for her, silence is never an option.",

    "text": "Environmental groups initiated global activities and protests from September 18 to 21 to drumbeat the call for urgent climate action amid the worsening pollution and continuing deterioration of the natural ecosystem. The series of protests were held right before the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and less than six weeks away from the UN Climate Summit (COP30) in Brazil. In Asia, the “Draw the Line” campaign highlighted the demand to phase out fossil fuels, build renewables, shift to sustainable food, and prioritize the people’s basic needs over corporate interests. Several countries participated in the campaign led by a network of environmental groups and community-based organizations. In the Philippines, the campaign was actively supported by local groups resisting projects and policies that threaten the lives and livelihoods of rural and coastal communities. A fluvial protest was organized in the town of Culasi in Antique province, located in the Visayas islands of the Philippines, to call attention to the demand of the small fisherfolk against the entry of commercial fishing operations in municipal waters. Javie Barcinal of 350.org Asia echoed the stand of small fishers. Small fishers are among the worst affected by the climate crisis, with warming seas resulting in dwindling catches each year. To make matters worse, the government has allowed industrial fishing to encroach into municipal waters. This exacerbates climate injustice that small fishers experience as hunger for their families. In Indonesia, environmnetalists organized at least 36 actions in 34 cities and provinces across the country on September 18, to push for bold reforms in government policies. A march was held towards the State Palace on September 19 as rallyists reiterated the anti-corruption demands of the youth-led protests that erupted in the country last month. Sisilia Nurmala Dewi of 350.org Indonesia led climate advocates in asserting an end to corruption to fund a better future. We draw the line as flash floods drown the innocent, while people’s voices against government failures are being silenced. Oligarchs and polluters have ruled this country for far too long, taking public money for climate action and destroying natural resources that should be preserved for future generations. We demand real, decisive action. President Prabowo must honor his promises by committing to 100 percent renewable energy in 10 years and a clear immediate plan to phase-out coal plants. Paskah Toga of Climate Rangers Bali cited the recent flooding disaster in Bali island to rally public opposition against fossil-based power plants. The recent deadly floods in Bali is clear evidence that the climate crisis is no longer a distant threat but a reality that needs to be resolved with concrete policies. The government must stop building fossil-based power plants and phase out fossil fuels. In Japan, protesters challenged the new leadership to phase out fossil fuels and to reverse policies that blame immigrants for the country’s social woes. Masayoshi Iyoda, 350.org Japan campaigner, summed up their demand. We draw the line on Japan’s rising contributions to climate chaos and war. As we experience both flash floods and extreme heat, workers suffer and food prices continue to soar. Japan’s new leadership must show political will to phase out fossil fuels and shift to 100% renewables, instead of going with the far-right tide of blaming immigrants for our economic woes and backsliding on climate action. The protest was also attended by activists who expressed solidarity with Palestinians by condemning the continuous bombings and military attacks in Gaza. In South Korea, Jiyun Gim of the Green Environment Youth Korea urged authorities to comply with the planned emissions reduction this year. South Korea’s 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) will be determined in November. We are drawing the line to prevent South Korea from setting a climate goal that falls below 60% emissions reduction. This is not just about numbers—it is the survival line for future generations. The government must set ambitious, science-based, and future-oriented climate targets. In Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh, community residents staged an action denouncing the planned revival of a coal plant. Shahrukh Karim, a youth leader in Matarbari, articulated the sentiments of the local community. We are burning, our lands are dying, and our rivers are drying up. We draw the line on building another coal plant, when the existing one has already driven away thousands of families and turned our homes into a wasteland. This needs to stop.

    "text": "Over 6,000 delegates gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, for the second Africa Climate Summit (ACS2), held from September 8 to 10, to search for Africa-driven solutions ahead of negotiations for the United Nations 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the world's largest annual environmental conference. The second Africa Climate Summit was organized to unite African leaders, youth, and partners in pushing for fair climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s role as a solutions hub, while preparing a common position ahead of COP30 negotiations. It was a pivotal moment for Africa to stake its claim as a leader in the global climate conversation. Leaders, activists, and young innovators came together to push for reforms in climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s youth voices. The gathering was themed around “Accelerating Global Climate Solutions: Financing for Africa’s Resilient and Green Development.” Ethiopia’s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, opened the event with a keynote that set the tone: Africa should not be seen only as a victim of climate challenges, but as a continent of solutions and innovations that could guide the world forward. He also proposed the “Africa Climate Innovation Compact” to produce 1,000 innovators by 2030, financed and owned by Africans. This vision was built on the momentum of the inaugural summit in Nairobi in 2023, which, importantly, was preceded by the African Youth Climate Assembly (AYCA). By doing so, organizers ensured that the majority-youth population of Africa was not just represented but central to shaping the conversation. The challenges Africa faces Africa continues to wrestle with the painful legacy of historical injustice and the harsh reality of a deepening climate crisis. Despite contributing the least to global emissions, the continent feels the impacts most acutely. Climate finance remains painfully inadequate as wealthy nations have consistently fallen short of their yearly pledge, and African countries today pay back about five times more in debt servicing than they receive in climate aid. The cost of this imbalance is causing hospitals to stretch beyond capacity as diseases like malaria and cholera spread more widely under shifting climatic conditions. Crops are failing under the weight of prolonged droughts or sudden floods, leaving farmers with empty fields and families without food. Coastal cities, from Lagos to Dar es Salaam, face rising waters that sweep away homes, businesses, and livelihoods. Yet at the same time, Africa holds some of the richest renewable resources on the planet. If harnessed, its solar capacity alone could power the world many times over. Africa holds 17 percent of the world’s population but receives just 3 percent of global climate investment. Restrictive financial systems and predatory loan arrangements often force African countries back into reliance on fossil fuels. EcoVista, a youth-led ecological justice movement whose main focus is on climate justice and the environment, based in Nairobi, Kenya posted on its X account: Fossil fuels are the biggest driver of the climate crisis, responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. #MakeThemPay Draw The Line pic.twitter.com/N9aUDWl8e8 — EcoVistaKe (@EcoVistaKE) September 19, 2025 Layered on top of that is a painful reminder of colonial history. While Africa’s minerals powered industrial growth in the Global North, the continent was left behind with ecological damage and struggling economies. Yearly natural disasters including cyclones, floods, and expanding deserts displace millions every year, and pushed African leaders at ACS2 to adopt the Addis Ababa Declaration, a clear and urgent call for change. With regard to the consequences facing Africa, Tangwa Abilu, a Cameroonian Climate and Environmental Activist, shared on X : The horn of Africa is grieving because their -Their farms are no longer yielding -Advancement of desert is alarming -Our major rivers are drying -Proliferation of pest and pathogens -Development of tropical diseases. -Our crop are dieing out. Climate change is a reality. pic.twitter.com/2MQ5fZG1Zo — Tangwa Abilu.🌿🌏🌾🍀🍃.SDG's. (@AbiluTangwa) December 29, 2024 In the same context, K. Diallo, an African author, drew attention to the damage caused by floods in December 2023. He posted on his X account: flood disaster in the DR Congo is a result of global warming meeting a failed state…..The global South bears more than 95% of the costs and deaths related to climate change despite making up less than 5% of consumption-based cumulative emissions above 350ppm CO2. pic.twitter.com/vTDobNNVl5 — K.Diallo ☭ (@nyeusi_waasi) December 31, 2023 Demands ahead of COP30 For African leaders, climate finance must shift from symbolic promises to meaningful reparations. They argue that financing should come as debt-free grants rather than loans that deepen dependency. Historic polluters owe this to frontline communities losing their farms to drought or their homes to rising seas. The Loss and Damage Fund, in particular, needs to prioritize these vulnerable communities with direct, rapid assistance: cash for families in sinking villages, support for starved farmlands, and investment in healthcare for climate-induced trauma. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said: Too often, Africa's story begins with what we lack: finance, technology, time. Let us instead begin with what we have: the youngest population in the world, vast solar resources, and the resilience to build a new climate economy. Leaders are also demanding stronger commitments from rich nations. During last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries from the global north pledged to pay USD300 billion in climate finance, but the amount falls far short of the USD1.3 trillion per year needed by African nations, who need it to effectively adapt and transition away from fossil fuels. ACS2 came at a crucial moment when the Lake Chad Basin, which once supported millions across Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic, had shrunk by over 90 percent. With it, the livelihoods of countless families have evaporated. Africa is both the most vulnerable to climate collapse and one of the most promising centers for climate solutions. As the world heads towards COP30 in Brazil in November, Africans say they do not just want to be heard, but are demanding to be recognized as solution builders and shapers of the planet’s shared future.",

    "text": "Yu Kongjian (俞孔坚), 62, the Chinese landscape architect who pioneered the concept of “sponge cities,” died in a plane crash in the Pantanal region, the largest tropical wetland in the world, in Brazil, on September 23, 2025. Three other people also died during the accident: pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, and filmmakers Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., who were both working with Yu to create a documentary about sponge cities. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Ferraz’s work focused on nonfiction productions, including a series about the 2016 plane crash involving the Brazilian football team, Chapecoense. Crispim Jr. worked on projects such as a documentary about Brazilian architect Vilanova Artigas and another about the first women’s football national team in Brazil. Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, posted condolences on his X account and highlighted Yu's work: Foi com tristeza e consternação que recebi a notícia do desastre aéreo ocorrido no Pantanal no início da noite desta terça-feira, 23. A tragédia, infelizmente, custou as vidas do piloto Marcelo Pereira de Barros, dos documentaristas Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz e Rubens… — Lula (@LulaOficial) September 24, 2025 It was with sadness and consternation that I received the news about the aircraft disaster that happened in the Pantanal regional, early Tuesday night, the 23rd. The tragedy, unfortunately, took the lives of the pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, documentarians Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., and the Chinese architect Kongjian Yu. In times of climate change, Kongjian Yu became a world reference for sponge cities, which unite life quality and environment protection: something we want — and need — for the future. To all the victims’ friends, family and coworkers, I leave my deepest sorrows. Yu’s legacy Yu was in Brazil to work on a documentary, but he had also recently attended the São Paulo International Architecture Biennale, which was themed “EXTREMES — Architectures for an overheated planet.” Raquel Schenkman, the Institute of Brazilian Architects’ president, responsible for the Biennale’s organization, told G1 Yu was “someone on the frontline of transformations in big urban centers facing climate change.” On its website, the Biennale published a note saying that, as the “creator of the theory of sponge cities, Yu Kongjian left a monumental legacy, also urgent to face climate crisis in cities,” and that his work, based on ecosystemic principles, “showed in a practical and poetic way how the landscape can be a vital infrastructure to urban resilience, integrating man to nature in a sustainable way.” Sponge cities concept Yu’s main legacy is designing and implementing projects based on his sponge cities theory. A professor at Peking University, his “sponge city” concept became a top national priority in China in 2013, following the massive floods in the Beijing region in 2012, which left 79 people dead and tens of thousands displaced. He also founded Turenscape, one of the main landscape architecture firms in the world, based in China. Yu cautioned against overly “grey” cities that rely too much on concrete and asphalt, which disrupt natural water pathways and prevent the ground from absorbing water. While conventional water management focuses on draining water through engineered drainage infrastructure, such as pipes and water channels, sponge cities rely on techniques such as green roofs, rainwater storage and infiltration systems, sunken green spaces, permeable pavement, bioretention ponds, wetland revitalization, restoring natural waterflow pathways, and more. “Floods are not enemies,” Yu explained in an interview with WeForum. “We can make friends with floods. We can make friends with water.” Yu’s approach to urban planning has been successfully implemented in dozens of cities in China, particularly after Chinese President Xi Jinping established his thoughts on ecological civilization in 2018. In the past decade, his natural landscape approach is becoming an important tool in city planning and water management around the world. In Southeast Asia, where recurring extreme weather events routinely cause massive floods that displace hundreds of thousands, many city planners are looking to sponge cities as a potential solution for unprecedented levels of rainfall. So far, the concept has mostly been implemented on a small scale in individual neighborhoods, streets, or areas, meaning its flood mitigation impacts are often limited to the local level, rather than city- or nationwide. On X, Zhongshan city's tourism promotion outlet, commemorates Yu's death by highlighting one of his landscape projects in the southern Chinese city: On September 23 (Brazilian time), Professor Yu Kongjian from the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at #Peking University, tragically passed away in a plane crash at the age of 62. Professor Yu had won numerous world-class #design awards, including the Oberlander Prize and the John Cobb Common Good Award. Among his representative works is the #QijiangPark in #Zhongshan, #Guangdong . This #park, transformed from the site of a former shipyard, opened in 2001 and quickly gained global attention, winning several domestic and international design awards. In designing and building the park, Professor Yu and his team preserved the original industrial relics, such as shipyard machinery, docks, and other structures, and repurposed them with new functions. [original English version from @Amzhongshan] Yu himself acknowledged that scaling up the pilot projects in Chinese cities was challenging. One of his sponge city projects in Zhengzhou faced backlash after a severe flood in 2021, which claimed 12 lives in the city, prompting many to express doubts about the practicality of his idea. Moreover, as China's coastal regions are highly industrialized, they demand cross-departmental collaboration, strong political will, and extensive administrative coordination to restore concrete riverbanks and seawalls to wetlands. In an interview with Brazilian news outlet G1, Yu said that on a scale of 1 to 10, his optimism regarding the world’s chances of reversing climate change ranked 4. He also mentioned water scarcity — one of the challenges his projects aimed to address — as the primary issue humanity will face over the next 25 years. A journalist living in China, Isabela Shi, shared Yu Kongjian’s last update on a Chinese social media platform: 🕯️No último vídeo que o arquiteto chinês Yu Kongjian divulgou na rede social chinesa, ele estava mostrando a viagem a Pantanal com equipa brasileira que tenta refletir sobre Planeta Esponja através de encolhimento de zonas húmidas. “Wonderful, amazing”, encantou ele pro Brasil. pic.twitter.com/fKn5ZKgIwe — Isabela Shi🇨🇳🇧🇷 (@ShiIsabela) September 25, 2025",

    "text": "This article by Adin Kadrić first appeared in Balkan Diskurs on September 12, 2025. An edited version is being republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement with the Post-Conflict Research Center (PCRC). Editor's note: Zenica is a city in the middle of Bosnia and Herzegovina with about 100,000 residents. It is noted for its ironworks industry as well as being home to one of the big prisons in ex-Yugoslavia, described in the cult rock song Zenica Blues. It is not often considered when speaking about art, making the significance of this initiative — which began during the war of 1992-1995 and still persists to this day — even more extraordinary. For over 30 years, the Zenica School of Comics has been not only an illustration school but a symbol of perseverance, cultural resistance, and lasting dedication to art. Initially conceived as an escape from the repression of the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and later, a platform for expression and creativity, the school has trained around 200 young artists. About 70 of them have gone on to become prominent young authors, whose works have left a mark on the domestic and regional comics scene. Several graduates are even acclaimed beyond the borders of their country, with Kenan Halilović, Biljana Šafaražik, and Zdravko Cvjetković being some of the most prominent. While the school has been synonymous with quality and creativity within the domestic comic scene for years, the international acclaim for these artists’ work underscores the fact that Zenica maintains a firm foothold in this visual medium. Recalling its beginnings, Adnadin Jašarević, the school’s founder and director of the Zenica City Museum, said that its primary goal was to give children a creative escape from the harsh realities of war. Under such conditions, comics were like Alice in Wonderland — providing an escape from hunger, fear, and shelling. An average of ten students still pass through the school every year, learning how to translate their thoughts, fears, and hopes into dynamic sequences of frames and speech clouds. Newer names like Filip Andronik, Milorad Vicanović, Senad Mavrić, and Enis Čišić represent the contemporary wave of comic artists from BiH. They actively cooperate with renowned publishers from the United States and Europe, demonstrating that despite its underdeveloped infrastructure, Bosnia and Herzegovina has comic creators who can stand equally alongside the best talent the genre has to offer. Publications such as “Horostop,” “ZE strip,” “EKO strip” and “SUV – Steps in Time” were created at the Zenica School, showcasing both its longevity and its dedication to comic culture. Explaining that the students themselves choose the topics they work on according to their own interests, Jašarević noted that he has “never stopped working” to ensure that comics remain a tool for expression and creative release. As far as technology’s impact on the comic industry goes, Jašarević explained that while comics used to be widely available to the masses, they are now becoming a far more exclusive product, with expensive integral editions and albums intended for a small but loyal audience. While the idea behind ​​comics as a liberating medium remains the same, the development of technology has heralded a turn in modern-day comic production. Cartoonist and former Zenica student Zdravko Cvjetković, in speaking about the impact of technology, emphasized that smart tablets have made drawing easier and faster for many artists, without compromising the quality of their work. However, he warned that AI tools — such as those used for generating text and images — pose serious ethical and aesthetic questions. He believes that the mass availability of tools that produce images and stories in seconds, threatens to trivialize art and blur the line between creativity and automation: “If we all become artists just because we have a tool in our pocket, then nobody is really an artist.” Many things about comics today, according to Cvjetković, are drastically different than before the war: “Comics are no longer accessible to such a wide audience, especially children. They’re too expensive and rarely found in newsstands.” The burgeoning Bosnian comics scene Pointing out that children today reach for screens before print media like comics or books, Cvjetković said that publishers are therefore targeting older generations who grew up with comics. A positive outcome of this is the growing number of comics festivals in the region, which promote a culture of reading and drawing. “Workshops and comics contests for children [are] an almost mandatory part of every serious festival,” Cvjetković emphasized, “and this is crucial in the absence of comics schools like the one in Zenica.” Comics culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina persists despite its modest ecosystem, in which there is almost no institutional support, and few major publishers or specialized festivals. However, thanks to the enthusiasm of individuals, the scene is not disappearing; in fact, it is quietly but steadily growing. Authors like Berin Tuzlić and Enis Čišić have been representing BiH on the regional and international comics scene for years. Tuzlić, known for his experimental approach and multimedia projects, combines comics with music and animation. Čišić, who also tried his hand at Marvel productions, represents a more contemporary, technically precise form of expression. Their work shows that the country is producing talent capable of competing globally. Ismet Erdić also holds a special place on the BiH comics scene, with his rare combination of historical storytelling and visual narration in comics about Kulin Ban and medieval Bosnia. His work has educational value and is often used in classrooms, which makes him one of the few authors whose comics reach the general public. Despite unfavorable conditions for comic distribution, publicity, and marketing, comics culture in BiH is still preserved as a niche interest by enthusiasts. Social networks, web comics, and regional cooperation with authors from Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia are currently key to their survival. So, while relatively small, the BiH comics scene has an authentic flair and great potential, waiting for better times ahead.",

    "text": "In Togo, a national initiative built on civic solidarity helps relieve parents’ yearly back-to-school expenses. Education is free and compulsory throughout the country, with a population of over 9.5 million. Following a two-month break (from mid-July to mid-September), more than 3 million students returned to school this month. While the authorities continue to work on improving education through teacher training and recruitment, investing in renovations and school infrastructure, the parents’ main priority is seeing their children succeed at the end of each school year. Over the years, there has been a marked increase in the gross enrollment rate and the proportion of Togolese students completing the school year. In April 2025, the local news website Lechiquier published: …le taut brut de scolarisation au primaire dépasse 100%. Il était de l’ordre de 111,70% en 2023, 116,70% en 2024 et une prévision de 116,20% pour l’année 2025. Dans le même sillage, le taux d’achèvement du primaire a évolué de 88,80% en 2023 à 94,60% en 2024. Pour l’année 2025, le gouvernement table sur une augmentation de 121,70%. The gross primary school enrolment rate now exceeds 100 percent. In 2023, it was approximately 111.70 percent, in 2024 it was 116.70 percent, and 116.20 percent is forecast for 2025. Similarly, the primary school completion rate increased from 88.80 percent in 2023 to 94.60 percent in 2024. For 2025, the government forecasts an increase to 121.70 percent. This rate of over 100 percent is due to it far exceeding the initial estimated value. Free school education Togo is one of five African countries with high enrollment rates in school, an impressive development stemming from the various reforms the authorities have implemented in the education sector. In 2008, Togo introduced free pre-school and primary education in the public sector. Since the beginning of the 2021–2022 school year, education in public secondary schools has also been free, a measure the authorities will maintain for the 2025–2026 school year. These measures help combat inequities in accessing education. However, efforts, such as providing student school kits (notebooks, books, pens, pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, and school bags), are still required to tackle inequality and ensure universal coverage. Togo’s guaranteed monthly minimum wage (SMIG) increased from FCFA 35,000 (USD 64) in 2012 to FCFA 52,500 (USD 95) in early 2023. Although this measure was introduced to support the Togolese working population of over 4 million, not all are content with its implementation, condemning the country’s ongoing poor economic situation and challenging living conditions. Association contributions Given the financial crisis, parents’ biggest concern is purchasing back-to-school supplies and kits. However, Togolese civil society provides solutions. Citizens, both young and old, are quick to lend their support to help parents meet these expenses. Numerous citizens, working as part of various associations, travel to the country’s villages and remote areas, assisting and supporting children, especially the most vulnerable. These efforts are a social and solidarity-based alternative to the associations committed to child protection, education, and development. One example is Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (the Togolese Child Protection Association or LTPE). On August 29, 2025, LTPE supported 5,000 children from 12 villages of the Amou Prefecture in the Plateaux region. Le 29 août 2025, plus de 5 000 enfants de la préfecture d’Amou venus de 12 localités différentes ont reçu des kits scolaires grâce à l’initiative « Éducation pour tous : 1 élève, 1 kit, 1 choix de vie » portée par la #LTPE. pic.twitter.com/LMroVuE9oY — Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (@LTPE_ONG) August 30, 2025 On August 29, 2025, more than 5,000 children from 12 different locations in the Amou Prefecture received school kits through the #LTPE initiative ‘Education for All: One student, one kit, one life choice.’ In an interview with Togolese media outlet Plume d'Afrique, Nina Afi Kazoulé, the LTPE coordinator, explained the scope of this measure: Nous voulons par cette action éviter le décrochage scolaire. Et nous savons que le décrochage scolaire peut être dû à l'incapacité financière des parents, aux grossesses en milieu scolaire, bref à tous les comportements qui ne sont pas appropriés à adopter par un apprenant. We want to prevent school dropouts with this measure. We know that school dropouts can happen due to the parents’ lack of financial resources, pregnancies among school girls, or any inappropriate student behavior In the village of Zooti N'titikope, Vogan, a town 45 kilometers northwest of the Togolese capital Lomé, the Togovi Bé Sourire association and Action for Peace and Good Governance (APGG) joined forces with several other associations on September 5 and 6 to support young learners. More than 300 vulnerable children received school kits, and 20 young girls will be monitored and supported in successfully reintegrating into school. Lomé also has vulnerable children supported by other groups, including the Premiers Pas pour l’Enfance (First Steps for Children or 3PE) association. Its mission is to promote equal education opportunities through solidarity initiatives, such as the payment of school fees and supply provision for children. Association President Akilou Demon told media outlet Ledefenseur: Nous voulons que tous les enfants aient accès à l’éducation, car l’enfant a droit à l’école. Si certains en sont privés, ce n’est pas juste. Notre ambition est de leur donner une chance égale de réussir et de contribuer demain au développement de notre patrie. As children have the right to attend school, we want all children to have access to education. Some are deprived, and this is not fair. We aim to give them equal opportunities to succeed and one day contribute to our country’s development. Although the results of various reforms are visible, shortcomings remain in Togo’s education system. School infrastructure, such as classrooms, is substandard, especially in villages. Students study in straw huts with few school benches (supplemented in some places with bricks) and are forced to move or interrupt their lessons due to adverse weather conditions. In 2021, these circumstances led to construction plans for 30,000 classrooms equipped with wooden class benches. However, in September 2024, the government reduced its improvement projects by more than half, going from 30,000 classrooms to just 14,632. While civil society can offset some of the education system’s shortcomings, it’s ultimately up to the state, which declared education free and compulsory, to improve education quality and train new teachers to achieve equal opportunities for all Togolese children.",

    "text": "This article, written by Artur Ferreira and Amanda Oliveira, was originally published on May 30, 2025, on the Agência Mural website. An edited version is published on Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement. In the collective imagination, the Romani people are associated with colourful clothing, parties, accessories, and an aura of mystery, embodying a wandering spirit. But beyond the stereotypes, there is a rich history of resistance and belonging that spans centuries, including in Brazil, in the outskirts of São Paulo. In universities, public offices, doctors’ offices, or their traditional campsites, they are fighting for their rights, against prejudice, and for recognition in a country where there are still shortcomings in caring for the diversity of these communities. In Itaim Paulista, a neighbourhood at the eastern end of the city, 250 people live in one of the main and oldest Romani campsites in the region. “Some Romanies palm read, dance, get dressed up in traditional clothing, but some are even evangelical, like myself, and they don’t all even live in camps. We are a people like any other,” the 32-year-old housewife Magda Santos says. She has been living in the camps for eight years with her husband and two children. “I am not Romani by blood, but I became one when I got married to one.” The Romani, also known as the Roma peoples, are an ethnic group that doesn’t have a single origin. One of the more widely accepted theories is that they are of Indian origin but have travelled the world since the 11th century in a great diaspora, dispersing throughout the Balkans, Western Europe, and later to other continents. While she was hanging clothes on the clothesline, 29-year-old seamstress Viviane Alves Pereira made sure to find an answer when asked about the main problems her people face. The statement came without hesitation: prejudice, invisibility and the lack of access to basic rights, a common scenario in marginalized neighbourhoods. Who are the Roma people from the outskirts? The majority of Romani who live on the outskirts of Greater São Paulo are of the Calon ethnicity, like Magda and Viviane. They are also those who suffer the most prejudice relating to maintaining their traditions and being most recognized as “gypsies” (a term now considered derogatory), because of their clothing and their nomadic lifestyle, according to sources from this report. In Brazil, there are two other Romani ethnic groups: the Roma and the Sinti peoples. They don’t wear traditional clothing, so they mostly go unnoticed in the cities. “Many Brazilians were already cared for by doctors, nurses and Romani lawyers, and maybe they don’t even know,” states activist Nicolas Ramanush, 64, who is the president of the NGO, Romani Embassy of Brazil (Embaixada Cigana do Brasil), in Santo André in the Greater São Paulo area. “In the region, Romani people were concentrated in the neighborhood of Itaim Paulista and in the cities of Itaquaquecetuba and Itapevi, with camps near the train stations,” he says. Each ethnicity is divided into subgroups, and each one develops its own customs, habits, religions and rituals. “In my ethnic group, for example, we always wear decorated shoes with a lot of details. Some Calon women are famous for their flowery dresses and for using handkerchiefs,” says Ramanush, who belongs to the Sinti ethnicity. This group has the fewest number of people in the country. “Today, if there are 100 families in Brazil, it is a lot,” says Ramanush. “This is because of the period of Nazism. The Sintis were almost exterminated. Among the Romani killed during the Holocaust, the majority were Sinti and Roma,” he adds. Ramanush notes that many aspects of Romani culture are integrated into the Brazilian lifestyle without most people realizing it. They were among those responsible for helping Carnival to grow, especially in the northeast, creating Carnival street blocks. Certain costumes, such as “La Ursa” (The Bear) in Recife, have a Romani origin. “Instruments like the seven or six-string guitar were brought to Brazil by the Roma people. Some samba dancers spoke about how living with the Romanies inspired them musically,” Ramanush says. Under the canvas tents Nomadic and outskirt-dwelling Romani have a routine defined by difficulties surrounding education for their children and lack of healthcare, caused by the lack of a stable address. They also face São Paulo’s structural problems, such as floods, and living under canvas tents, without safety. One of the most impactful natural disasters was the flooding in February 2025 in the far east of São Paulo, in the region known as Jardim Pantanal. The streets and houses remained underwater for several days. The Romani in these camps had to face that situation under the tents. “We spent days underwater, and it was the neighbors from the region who helped us,” Santos remembers with outrage. The camp’s inhabitants had to deal with a lack of drinking water; tents were affected, and according to local accounts, they had to make a joint effort to avoid major losses of furniture and appliances while the flooding advanced. Just like Santos, Ramanush believes that the first step to improving the Romani community’s life in the outskirts of Brazil is for them not to be invisible. Prejudice and invisibility Even with initiatives such as the National Day of Roma Peoples, commemorated every May 24 since 2006, some rights are still neglected. For example, Romani people are not recognized in the national census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Santos remembers the difficulty she faced in registering her children’s ethnic group in their identity documents. Since there is no official recognition of “Romani” ethnicity, she ended up registering them by their skin color. “There are policies catered to Indigenous peoples, Black and Brown people, but not for Romani people. We have our own culture, but we do not show up, which is why I say being Romani is being invisible,” she claims. Ramanush experienced a similar situation when a census taker visited him during the most recent census in Brazil in 2022. “She asked me what my race was, and I answered that it was not on the list. My complexion is white, but I’m a Romani.” IBGE estimates that Brazil has between 800,000 and a million Romani, but the Roma groups believe the numbers are higher. “I've already travelled all over Brazil meeting Romani people from all ethnic groups. Without official data, there are no efficient public policies,” Ramanush explains. “Even to count how many Romani there are in each city or town, local governments make the process difficult.” Besides the lack of recognition, Romani people living in peripheral areas also face a prejudice that runs through generations. They have been accused of theft, robbery, and deception for centuries. It wasn’t rare to have them associated with kidnapping children. Trying to change this reality and fight prejudice, Romani groups have been mobilized for the approval of a bill making teaching Romani culture and history in schools mandatory — modeling what already happens with Black and Indigenous people in Brazil. The proposal presented by federal deputy Helder Salomão (PT, Workers’ Party), at the Chamber of Deputies as Bill 3547 of 2015, has made little progress. In their justification, the text reinforces the idea that for centuries Romani groups have been experiencing prejudice, marginalization, exclusion and persecution. So, the bill aims to “change the image of Romani populations, trying to reduce prejudice and discrimination that these groups are subjected to.” The bill also asserts that providing visibility for Romani groups “will provide a more fertile ground to build public policies focusing on the promotion of human rights.”",

    "text": "This article was published by Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand. An edited version has been republished by Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement. Between July and May 2025, tensions between Thailand and Cambodia over a border dispute devolved into violence that left at least 43 dead on both sides, dozens injured, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Despite signing a ceasefire agreement on July 28, hostility has remained deeply embedded in both countries, fueled by misinformation. Amidst the turmoil, Cambodians and Thais have come together to launch a cross-border campaign aimed at combating hatred and promoting empathy and lasting peace. Thailand and Cambodia share over 700 kilometres of border, where several undemarcated sections have been long-standing sources of conflict between the two countries, since the Preah Vihear dispute beginning in the 1950s, to this year when clashes broke out on May 28th and led to fatalities on July 24th. On top of that, the countries also share historical and cultural ties, which have complicated the tensions between them, leading to deep-rooted hostility between the two peoples. Hostility skyrocketed after the July 24 armed conflict as the conflict between the two governments trickled down to all facets of society. Cambodian and Thai netizens traded accusations on who initiated the clashes. “We see all the problems start to unfold, and when hatreds, prejudice, and discrimination on people’s level have gone online, it was even more devastating for us, and that's why we decided to come together on the Cambodian side to rally among ourselves,” said Lim Solinn, a Cambodian social activist and artist. She later reached out to friends in Thailand in different places and then stumbled upon a group of Thai people who are a network of solidarity. Ou Tepphallin, a Cambodian labor rights activist and campaign co-organizer, said she joined the campaign to address the suffering of migrant workers and communities caught in the crossfire of recent tensions, particularly Cambodian workers in Thailand and Thai workers in Cambodia. They faced physical violence and racism, and they were living with fear, so their voices were unheard. On top of that, children living along the border have lost opportunities to study due to the closure of border crossings. Family members were separated, such as a child whose mother was in Thailand but whose father was in Phnom Penh, and they have no idea when they can be reunited. In addition, according to the Thai authorities, the conflict since July 24th has also caused over 500,000 Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand to return home, since most of them felt unsafe and threatened in Thailand. This has left Thailand with a significant labor shortage as Cambodian migrants typically played an essential role in the country's agricultural industry. Solinn stated that both Thai and Cambodian campaign organizers want the campaign to go viral in both countries and send messages to leaders saying, “Please don't use violence on Cambodian or Thai migrant workers.” The campaigners are also trying to figure out catchy ways for this campaign to go viral and reach regular Thais and Cambodians. The campaign includes writing poems and making songs, which they believe could help calm people and encourage them not to hate simply because of what they heard or saw on the news. “We’re just starting, even if the war ends tomorrow, the hatred continues, so we need to continue this work and reach out to more communities in Cambodia and in Thailand,” said Solinn. Phallin added that it's time to heal those who suffered from both sides, and that is what the campaign did by starting to send healing messages to ordinary people. When hatred is louder than empathy In Thailand, when the armed conflict erupted and innocent Thai civilians and military personnel were killed, many Thai netizens demanded tit for tat retaliation. In addition, right-wing influencers have threatened Cambodian migrant workers and called on patriots to use violence against them. Often, those who oppose this and call for a peaceful approach face condemnation online for being too optimistic or unpatriotic. “All the ordinary Cambodians want nothing but peace and harmony with our neighbours, and a lot of people get caught in between these polarizations, and because of the level of their vulnerability, they cannot get their voices heard at all,” noted Solinn. On the Cambodian side, Solinn remarked that while they wanted peace and for this war to stop, most Cambodians also became enraged and emotional when they saw news about civilians being affected, schools being bombed, or news that many people were displaced. She disclosed that since she and her friends launched the campaign, she has been harassed by netizens from both countries. For her, it has been difficult to get through to people how the hyper-nationalistic, violent narratives are spreading hate. Solinn said: They have been misinformed and disinformed. They believe these sets of stories, and they have these perspectives, and it's hard to change. So, instead of trying to tell them a different version, we’re trying to appeal to their consciousness. We try to appeal to their empathy. Even though most of the information they received was not real, it was effective as it was coupled with prejudice, stereotyping, and hate speech amplified by social media. “It has added fuel to the fire of ultra nationalist perspectives. It just made it really hard for people to try to bridge across for people who are like us,” said Solinn. She insisted that engaging with the same outrage and accusing each other of doing what each side thinks is wrong will not improve the situation, particularly for disputes that have been going on for hundreds of years, based on selective history from both sides. Solinn emphasized that it was time to put people’s lives first. Children should be able to return to school instead of living in refugee camps, families should be able to earn their livelihoods again, and both countries need to recognize the damage the conflict has inflicted on their economies. A call for peace: rebuilding trust and fostering empathy “We would like to urge the leaders to sit down and find a peaceful resolution and put the people first,” said Phallin. She also urged the leaders to negotiate and rebuild trust, insisting that peace can be achieved only by negotiation, not war. In the meantime, Solinn urged the leaders to be compassionate and gentle and to reach a peaceful resolution, adding that a tremendous amount of strength is required. The campaign organizer also called on leaders on both sides to stop this war and allow everything to return to normal for the sake of the innocent people from both countries. She suggested that Thailand and Cambodia stop promoting biases and stereotypes based on selective interpretations of history, particularly for the younger generations. Solinn also believes that when this war ends, Thais and Cambodians will come together to create mixed communities where people from both sides could share safe spaces and raise awareness of peace and harmony. “Educating in school or through the media wouldn't be enough. We need all the spaces, all the communities, we need a whole society to heal and to promote racial tolerance, peace, solidarity, and harmony,” said Phallin. In terms of media, Solinn said media, particularly mainstream media, in both countries should not amplify hateful rhetoric, which has already been dominant on social media, but rather people’s stories, which would help promote reconciliation and peace, suggesting that selective parts of the history on both sides shouldn’t be allowed to frame the whole narrative about Thailand and Cambodia. She noted that we did not know everything, but only heard different sides of the story. Each side believed the other started the war first or believed that the other side encroached upon their land. “Trust is so fragile. It's so easy to break, and it's broken already. It's very hard to rebuild, but we must try. We do not have a choice,” noted Solinn.",

    "text": "Nigeria’s whistleblower policy, introduced on December 21, 2016, was designed as a quick fix to expose systemic corruption. It promised whistleblowers between 2.5 and 5 percent of recovered looted public funds. However, while the policy incentivizes disclosures, it does not guarantee protection. Instead, whistleblowers often face surveillance, dismissal, or even death threats. Multiple attempts to pass a whistleblower protection bill over the years have stalled in Nigeria’s National Assembly, leaving whistleblowers legally vulnerable. Nigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework On September 18, 2025, Federal High Court judges and civil society advocates debated on Nigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework at a national interactive forum convened by the African Centre for Media & Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) for federal high court judges, in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city. Harry Ogwuche, the Director of Economic and Social Rights at Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), shared during the debate: Protecting whistleblowers is not an abstract anti-corruption strategy; it is a direct, proactive investment in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights as enshrined in Chapter IV of our Constitution and various international covenants Nigeria is party to. The role of judges in protecting whistleblowers While seeking the support of judges in the advocacy for a whistleblower protection law in Nigeria, Chido Onumah, Coordinator of AFRICMIL, said: Judges are key actors in any judicial system. Therefore, the forum aims to provide a platform for interaction with judges on whistleblowing, its legal framework, and the critical role they play in ensuring justice for whistleblowers and handling corruption cases effectively. At the forum, persecuted whistleblower Yisa Usman shared how he was pressured, intimidated, and sidelined from his profession after blowing the whistle on his company. Usman is a chartered accountant who worked in the finance and accounts department, but after exposing corruption, he was redeployed to the ICT department, transferred to different states, and subsequently fired. He said: Because I decided to speak up, I am jobless. I was ostracized and frustrated to accept the norm. To remain silent is to be complicit. To achieve results as a whistleblower, it is important to be familiar with the laws because if you know the laws that guide and protect you, you will be able to challenge them. Despite several attempts to detain me, I am walking free because of the judiciary. Existing and pending laws to protect whistleblowers Nigeria’s Constitution and several statutes already contain protections that could be extended to whistleblowers. These include: Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. Section 6(4)(c) of the National Human Rights Commission Act prohibits harassment of individuals who cooperate with the Commission. Anti-corruption laws like the EFCC Act and ICPC Act provide limited safeguards. The Freedom of Information Act protects disclosures made in good faith. In practice, these fragmented provisions are inconsistently applied, and without a unified protection law, whistleblowers continue to face retaliation. Nigeria’s situation contrasts sharply with that of its regional neighbors. Ghana’s Whistleblower Act (Act 720) and South Africa’s Protected Disclosures Act provide dedicated mechanisms. Vladimir Radomirović, a Serbian journalist and co-founder of Pištaljka, an organization based in Belgrade that provides free legal aid and protection to whistleblowers, shared his experiences of building alliances with the judiciary to strengthen whistleblower protection in Serbia. He said: The judges have a very influential role in protecting whistleblowers in Serbia, and we try to work with judges and allow them to hear from whistleblowers about how they are retaliated against for protecting the public interest. AFRICMIL and its partners urged the Nigerian legislature to urgently enact the whistleblower protection law, one that guarantees anonymity, provides penalties against retaliation, and establishes an independent body to oversee cases. Whistleblowers and civil society organizations appealed to judges to embrace a proactive role in safeguarding whistleblowers. They called for progressive adjudication that interprets existing laws in the spirit of transparency and protection for defenders; expedited hearings to ensure justice is not delayed and therefore denied; the awarding of exemplary damages against retaliators to serve as a deterrent; and above all, the protection of anonymity in court procedures. These recommendations, they argued, are vital if the judiciary is to strengthen trust, uphold justice, and ensure that whistleblowing truly serves as a tool for accountability in Nigeria.",

    "text": "There are nearly 4,900 registered print media outlets in Nepal. Around eighteen news outlets operate exclusively online through digital platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. By law, online media must register with Nepal’s Department of Information and Broadcasting; however, not all outlets currently comply with this requirement. Standing out among these registered outlets is Khoj Samachar, an independent digital media platform that raises awareness among young people, challenges corruption, and amplifies underrepresented voices in Nepal. Its founder, Roshan Shrestha, is an investigative journalist from Nepal. His approach relies on digital platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and a dedicated app to draw public attention to marginalized stories and pressure authorities to take action. The platform publishes content in Nepali, in both text and video formats. Abdulrosheed Fadipe of Global Voices interviewed Roshan via WhatsApp to discuss his journey as an investigative journalist and how he uses digital platforms to promote social change, strengthen good governance, and encourage citizen engagement in Nepal. Global Voices (GV): What inspired you to start Khoj Samachar, and what challenges did you face in building it from scratch? Roshan Shrestha (RS): I started my journalism journey during my school years at Shree Bachchhala Devi Higher Secondary School, Nagpuje, Sindhupalchok District, in Bagmati Province of Nepal. When I was in class 8, a man who was the presenter at Avenues Television came to my school to teach students about journalism. That training programme planted the seed of journalism in my mind. My interest in journalism grew after a devastating earthquake occurred in Nepal in 2015. Although the epicenter of the earthquake was located in Gorkha district, many houses in my village, which is located near the Bhotekoshi River, were destroyed. Many people lost their lives. The Tataponi border crossing with China was also closed. I had just completed class 11 then. I was using a simple Android phone because I was from a low-middle-class family that depended on agriculture for a living. With that phone, I started filming and uploading videos of the earthquake's destruction of villages on a YouTube channel. This was how my journalism career began. In 2021, I officially launched Khoj Samachar. I did not receive any financial support when I started nor did I have a big team. Now we have a team of four individuals broadcasting news in both English and Nepali. GV: How do you maintain editorial independence and ensure your outlet's content remains unbiased and free from external influences? Roshan Shrestha (RS): We do not take money, favors, or support from any political party, business group, or outside donor. From day one, Khoj Samachar has survived only through the income we earn from Facebook and YouTube ads. With those limited earnings, we pay our team and run the entire platform. This is not always easy, but it gives us full freedom. Nobody can tell us what to say or what to hide. We can question leaders, expose corruption, and speak for the people without fear of losing sponsors or upsetting funders. Our only loyalty is to our readers and viewers. For us, independence is more valuable than comfort. Even if the road is difficult, we choose truth over compromise — that is why our content remains unbiased and trusted. GV: How do you prioritize stories that amplify underrepresented media voices, and what impact do you hope these stories have on your audience? Roshan Shrestha (RS): At Khoj Samachar, we always give priority to the voices that big media often ignores — farmers, workers, rural youth, and ordinary citizens who face injustice. Many times, people from villages directly contact us to share their pain, because they feel unheard elsewhere. We have highlighted stories like that of a person struggling to get a bridge built in his village, a road left unfinished for 10 years, or a family trapped in hardship without support. By showing these issues through videos, we try to bring public attention and pressure the authorities to act. Our hope is that by giving a platform to these underrepresented voices, young people will feel more connected, more aware, and inspired to raise their own voices. We want our audience to see that journalism is not only about leaders and cities, but also about the real struggles of common people — and that truth can bring real change. GV: What strategies do you use to reach audiences beyond capital cities, and how do you measure the impact of your reporting in these areas? Roshan Shrestha (RS): From the beginning, our focus was not only on Kathmandu but also on rural and remote areas. We create stories that reflect the real problems of villages — like missing bridges in Humla, neglected roads in Dailekh, or migrant workers’ struggles. Many of these issues are sent to us directly by local people through phone calls, Facebook messages, or our app. By turning their voices into reports and videos, we make sure their problems are heard nationally. To measure impact, we look at the response from citizens and authorities. For example, in Saudi Arabia, when stranded workers contacted us, our coverage led to parliamentary debates and direct government action. Similarly, when we cover local problems, we monitor community feedback in comments, shares, and messages, and also check if the government or local representatives respond. For us, the real impact is when ordinary people feel their voices are finally heard and some positive change begins. GV: What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced as an independent journalist, and how have you overcome them? RS: There have been many difficult moments in my journey, but the most painful ones came when some people, who are unable to accept the truth, started abusing my family and even threatened physical attacks in public. As a journalist, I can tolerate criticism and risk, but when my family is dragged into controversy for my work, it is truly unbearable. Speaking the truth, especially against corruption and powerful figures, always brings political pressure. Many tried to silence us or scare us into stopping, but journalism loses its meaning if we compromise with fear. What keeps me going is the trust and support of the public and the inner courage to always speak the truth. The emotional burden is heavy, but I continue because ordinary people rely on us to be their voice, and that responsibility gives me the strength to move forward. GV: How do you envision the future of Khoj Samachar, and what steps are you taking to ensure its sustainability and continued impact? RS: My main goal is to build Khoj Samachar as a platform based only on truth and facts, not dependent on external funding or political power. The message I want to pass to youth is that they can succeed in journalism by standing for the truth, even if they are alone. I am working to add more features to the Roshan Shrestha App so that it will be useful for the public. This step will help us sustain our work, expand our impact, and keep serving society with independent journalism. GV: Why did you name the Roshan Shrestha App after yourself? RS: By putting my own name on the app, I wanted to assure users that this platform is genuine, transparent, and trustworthy. It is not for self-promotion but rather a matter of responsibility: if my name is attached, people know they can rely on it.",

    "text": "Today, Global Voices is launching a donation campaign to raise USD 250,000 to keep our news and translation sites running. Historically, Global Voices has been primarily supported by foundations and other grant-makers, and we’re grateful for the funding we receive that way. But sharp cuts to foreign aid by a number of governments are shrinking the available funds for nonprofits, with digital rights organizations like ours taking a particular hit. And it’s a hard time for news and translation organizations right now, with new technologies being used to cut staff and mass-produced disinformation crowding out quality news. Even in this challenging time, Global Voices’ production and readership have been going up, but since we are committed to never paywalling and not showing ads, that doesn’t translate into covering our running costs unless readers donate. Global Voices is a relatively low-cost organization to run: we have no office, no rent, and few physical supplies. We pay for the servers that host our site and a few other administrative costs, but by far the majority of our expenses are for paying our staff. Many grants don’t want to fund more than a small percentage of personnel costs, because they want to pay directly for activities, but personnel costs are the basis of all our activities. Our staff and our volunteers research stories, write and edit, translate and advocate — and sometimes they also do graphic design or photo choice, social media promotion, and more. That is who we’re trying to support with the funds from this campaign — our community, the people who make the articles and essays, translations, research reports, and podcasts that you find on our site. If we had a dollar for every page view of the site, we wouldn't need to do a campaign! And if each of those dollars were a monthly commitment, we’d be able to plan ahead for longer-term activities and be generally less stressed. But we know that not everyone can contribute for lots of different reasons, so instead we can think about it as five dollars from one-fifth of the monthly site visits, or ten dollars from one-tenth, and maybe someone who hasn't read anything this month but believes in what we do kicks in twenty-five bucks, and someone else who loves translations sends another fifteen and… you get the idea. We hope that you can be one of those contributors, and if you can’t right now, we hope you still come and spend time on our site, and then tell other people about it. Even more than a news site, Global Voices is a community, and we’d like you to be a part of it. We’ll be sharing about the campaign and about Global Voices on social media, so please repost so more people learn about us and how they can get involved. Thank you for your support! Donate",

    "text": "By Grecia Flores Hinostroza In Peru, women’s rights exist in a strange paradox: on paper, we have the laws, the representation, and the international commitments that promise equality; in reality, our lives tell a different story. Political progress coexists alongside persistent neglect, with numbers that flatter and figures that fail. This contradiction is not hidden in the shadows — the painful contrast is written plainly in the numbers we so proudly display. According to the SDG Gender Index, Peru scores 72.9 for “Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments,” a figure that suggests progress, visibility, and leadership. And yet, when we shift our gaze to health, the score drastically drops to 35.5, barely half. Women are present in Congress, but absent from the healthcare system that should protect them. If political participation alone were enough, our streets would be safer, our hospitals accessible, and our voices heard beyond the voting booth. But in Peru, as in much of Latin America, representation has not broken the chains of inequality — it has simply made them less visible to those who govern. The data tells one story. The lives of rural, Indigenous, and poor women tell another — one where access to basic sexual and reproductive health services is a distant reality. Where hospitals, experts, and care are unreachable. As the political scientist Stéphanie Rousseau notes in “The Politics of Reproductive Health in Peru,” “Although health sector reforms have had some positive impact on women’s reproductive health, the many restrictions placed on women’s right to reproductive choices have blocked further progress.” The consequences are not abstract. In 2020, Peru’s maternal mortality ratio stood at 69 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the World Health Organization, far above the Latin American average of 45 and nearly five times that of Chile (16) and Uruguay (13). These numbers represent women whose lives could have been saved by timely care, safe births and the fulfilment of rights already recognized by law. But these injustices are not only moral failures; they are legal betrayals. Peru has signed its name beneath international promises: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and others. These are not distant treaties gathering dust in diplomatic archives. They are binding commitments, written to safeguard the dignity, health, and safety of women — commitments meant to reach every hospital room, courtroom, and remote village in our country. Laws protecting sexual and reproductive health rights exist on paper, but they remain distant from the realities of rural, Indigenous, and poor women. Clinics lack essential services. Comprehensive reproductive care is unavailable. Legal frameworks declare equality, but equality disappears in places where women still face forced pregnancies, unsafe births, and systemic neglect. The Constitution speaks of equality, but equality does not walk the roads where women carry their pregnancies alone. The Ministry of Health issues protocols, but those protocols do not save lives when the nearest health centre is closed, or when the only doctor is gone. Rights without access are hollow. Commitments without implementation are betrayal. In this context, political representation must not be mistaken for liberation. We cannot accept the illusion of progress that comes from more women in office if it is not matched by concrete action to dismantle structural barriers. Empowerment is not an empty slogan — it is the lived reality without fear, accessing healthcare without barriers, and raising one’s voice without retaliation. The gap between law and life is not an abstract policy flaw; it is a daily crisis. It is the young girl in a rural province forced to give birth after sexual assault because abortion is inaccessible. It is the mother who dies on the way to a hospital that never has the capacity to treat her. Likewise, it is the Indigenous community where reproductive rights exist only in the language of faraway courts, not in the practice of local healthy systems. If we measure success only by the presence of women in power, we ignore the absence of justice in their communities. Numbers in parliament cannot compensate for empty maternity wards. International recognition cannot replace the right to safe childbirth. I call on the Peruvian Congress to legislate not for appearances, but for autonomy. To ensure that health, safety, and dignity are realities in every province. I call on international donors to fund the fight for reproductive freedom, not just political participation. And I call on Peruvian society to recognize that representation without rights is no victory at all. Representation matters. But it is only the beginning. Real empowerment is when every woman controls her future — her body, her health, her voice — regardless of where she was born or how far she lives from the capital. Until the day, the paradox will remain, and progress will be a promise half-kept.",

    "text": "This analysis by Nataša Stanojević was originally published by the International and Security Affairs Centre (ISAC), part of the regional initiative Western Balkans Anti-Disinformation Hub. An edited version is republished by Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement. The protest held on June 28 this year in Belgrade, on the Serbian national and religious holiday, Vidovdan, represented the culmination of months of public discontent with government policies and systemic societal problems. Vidovdan is deeply rooted in national history and collective memory and has often been used as a symbol of political and moral struggle. In this case, students and other citizens chose the date to underscore the seriousness of their demands for responsible governance, to call for snap elections, and advocate for essential institutional reforms. According to estimates, the protest gathered around 140,000 people, making it one of the largest political gatherings in the past decade. The sheer size of the turnout reflects profound social frustration and a sense that institutional mechanisms for expressing discontent have completely failed. However, while the organizers’ demands were clearly defined — fighting corruption, institutional accountability, and democratization of the system — pro-government media constructed an entirely different picture. Instead of fact-based reporting, the public sphere was flooded with sensationalist headlines and claims aimed at delegitimizing the protests and criminalizing participants. The student movement and citizens were not portrayed as advocates of democratic values, but as a threat to the stability of the state. This strategy of criminalization, typical of authoritarian regimes, allowed the authorities to justify the use of force and intensified repression. Pro-government media in Serbia systematically employ false and manipulative narratives to discredit legitimate civic protests and normalize the state’s repressive responses. Analysis shows that key propaganda tactics include labeling participants, manipulating events, constructing an image of a foreign enemy, and glorifying police force. These practices have long-term consequences for democratic processes and freedom of expression. Instruments of the propaganda narrative One of the most commonly used strategies was the deployment of pejorative labels. Organizers and participants were not referred to as students or citizens but as “blockaders,” “hooligans,” and “terrorists.” A headline in the tabloid newspaper Informer, “Anti-hooligan operation in the city center: Watch how blockaders are arrested,” illustrates how police intervention was presented as necessary and legitimate, while citizens were criminalized. The term “terrorists” carries particularly strong connotations, suggesting extremism, even though the protests were peaceful in nature. Media outlets widely circulated narratives about an alleged “hellish plan” by demonstrators. Headlines such as “Bridges and the entire city under siege: The new hellish plan of blockader terrorists, they want blood and dead bodies on the streets!” create an atmosphere of fear and suggest inevitable escalation into violence. These unfounded claims serve to mobilize the government’s loyal voter base and legitimize repressive measures. Rhetoric about “blood on the streets” and “danger to citizens” not only criminalizes protest participants but also frames them as a national security threat. Pro-government discourse attributed goals to the protesters, such as “destroying the state” and “overthrowing the president.” These claims are not based on any documents or public statements by organizers, whose demands focused on improving safety, fighting corruption, and ensuring political accountability. Introducing accusations of “treason” and “collaboration with enemies” is part of a broader model of political propaganda in which social resistance is portrayed as a conspiracy against national interests. While pro-government media insisted on an image of violent demonstrations, actual events tell a different story. According to reports from independent media and human rights organizations, the majority of the protest was peaceful. This was also confirmed by the Council of Europe. The few incidents that occurred happened only after police intervention, during which excessive force was used. The arrests or detentions of hundreds of people, along with documented cases of physical abuse, clearly show that state repression was the dominant dynamic. This gap between the media narrative and empirical facts is a classic example of the framing technique — selective presentation of reality to shape public opinion. The broader political context and the foreign enemy narrative Particularly concerning is the strategy of linking the protests to alleged foreign enemies, in this case, Croatia. Certain tabloids and politicians suggested that the organizers of the protests were instruments in the hands of Croatian intelligence structures and that their goal was the destabilization of Serbia. These claims have no factual basis, but serve a clear propaganda purpose: to evoke historical tensions and use national stereotypes to create a sense of threat among citizens. (The hostilities between Serbia and Croatia have deep roots in their national narratives. These tensions began during the Ottoman Empire when many Serbian refugees were settled in Croatia by the Austrian authorities. The animosity intensified during World War II when Croatia joined the Axis powers, and was solidified during the wars that accompanied Yugoslavia’s breakup. This period culminated in Operation Storm, which resulted in the majority of Serbs fleeing Croatia.) The use of Croatia in this narrative has a dual function: first, to mobilize patriotic sentiment; by suggesting that the protests are connected to a “hostile state,” the government reinforces its image as the defender of national interests. Second, it discredits the opposition and civic initiatives; by attributing “foreign influence” to the protests, the government delegitimizes their goals and diverts attention from internal problems such as corruption and institutional breakdown. This rhetoric relies on the well-known model of “constructing a foreign enemy,” which, according to political communication theory, serves to homogenize the electorate and justify authoritarian practices. A particularly alarming segment of the propaganda campaign concerns the linkage of protests with the issue of Srebrenica. (The 1995 massacre of the Muslim population in Srebrenica and its surrounding areas by the Army of Republika Srpska is frequently exploited by both nationalist and anti-Western factions in Serbia. Similar to narratives that deny the Holocaust, discussions about Srebrenica range from complete denial to unsettling debates about the number of victims, their nationality, and the use of terms like “necessary military action” and “collateral damage.” Over the past 15 years, anyone who does not support these narratives has been labeled a “traitor” or a “Western agent” in official political discourse.) In an Informer article entitled “They’ve exposed themselves! This is blockader politics: Accusing Serbia of a nonexistent genocide in Srebrenica,” students were accused of “agreeing with accusations that brand Serbs as a genocidal nation.” This narrative attempts to shift the focus from demands for democratization to a national question, creating the impression that the protests have an “anti-Serbian agenda.” In this way, civic resistance is criminalized through manipulation of one of the most emotionally charged issues in the public sphere. A similar rhetoric is used by the portal Vaseljenska in the article “Blockaders want to declare Serbs a genocidal nation: Elections, then a government that will recognize the genocide in Srebrenica.” These claims are absent from any official demands of the organizers, but their function is clear: to discredit the protests by linking them with alleged plans to “betray national interests.” Thus, the government constructs a narrative in which students are not only “hooligans” but also agents of dangerous ideological and political projects. Narrative vs objective facts In the long term, such practices lead to the consolidation of authoritarian patterns of governance. When every criticism of regime representatives is labeled as “treason” or “terrorism,” the space for democratic dialogue disappears. This not only delegitimizes protests but also undermines the fundamental values on which modern democratic societies rest. This analysis of the media narrative surrounding the Vidovdan protests demonstrates that pro-government media act as a propaganda apparatus whose primary function is the preservation of political power, not informing the public. Through the dissemination of a distorted perception of civic resistance, the construction of violent scenarios, and the invention of foreign enemies, the authorities succeed in delegitimizing valid social demands and justifying repressive measures. Such a strategy may stabilize the regime in the short term, but in the long run, it erodes the foundations of democracy and leads to further political and social crises.",

    "text": "This Dart Centre Asia Pacific Report by Arun Karki was originally published in Nepali Times, and an edited version has been republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement. What should a journalist do when young protesters are shot in front of her? Does she do her job and stay neutral? Can you stay neutral? As Gen Z protests engulfed Kathmandu, Nepal's journalists found themselves reporting a story that was personal. While doing their job, some of them were even targeted by mobs. Read More: Gen Z stands up to expose corruption in Nepal Dart Asia Pacific Fellow Arun Karki visited their newsrooms and spoke with his colleagues about their experience of reporting the Gen Z protests that erupted on September 8th. These are the first-hand accounts of journalists who witnessed the turmoil in the city they call home. Sunita Karki was at a workshop in a hotel on September 8th. She saw the first waves of protests through hotel windows. Curfew alerts flooded her phone, a vehicle belonging to a human rights group sat burning across the road, young boys were taking their wounded friends on motorbikes to local hospitals, and police were beating a teenager with their hands raised. “I cried a lot,” she said, but the tears were not out of fear — they were because she felt guilt. “I couldn’t write the news. We were witnessing these scenes from a five-star hotel.” By evening, the death toll had reached 19. On September 9th at about 3:35 pm, her outlet, the Annapurna Post's office in Tinkune, Kathmandu, was set on fire. Staff had to leave the building as parts of the newsroom burned down. When she knew her office was burning, she anxiously told her husband that she would resign from the job: “If we have to hide our identification cards in every protest, what kind of journalist am I?” she asked herself. She filed a story the next day, but her emotions kept bouncing between those of a journalist bound to duty and a civilian in shock. She said that in moments like this, it’s hard to feel truly neutral. After watching the police beat people, she felt a strong urge to step in, not just stand back and report. The first real calm came later, when people came to the street and lit candles together in honor of those who were killed. “This was a sort of victory procession. I felt some relief after brutal days,” she said. Angad Dhakal a photojournalist who works at Kantipur National Daily, was standing outside his office building when protesters stormed in and set parts of it on fire. He had already been informed that protesters were planning to torch his office building and rushed to his office hoping to save his hard drives containing ten years of photography work. He failed. He raised his camera and “forcefully” pressed the shutter — more to document the scene than out of “professional enthusiasm or duty.” “My office was burning. What should I photograph?” he recalled. A few moments later, a protester noticed the “PHOTO” label on his yellow Press jacket. Dhakal deflected it by saying he was an early-career freelancer and YouTuber. He went into a corner and took his jacket off so that protesters wouldn't target him. When it comes to covering street protests, Angad usually stands near the police because it feels safer. But on September 8th, fire and gunshots made even that area unsafe. A rubber bullet hit his friend Dipendra Dhungana, badly injuring him. He thought, “Where do we go now? If we stay here, we’ll be hit.” After witnessing two days of protests, violence, and killings, and seeing his own office burning, he couldn't sleep for days. The same afternoon that government buildings burned and media outlet Kantipur was attacked, a message in a protest Discord forum talked openly of “attacking Kantipur.” Rumors spread to other outlets. Outside OnlineKhabar's office, where Gaurav Pokharel works, the newsroom manager said, “Very suspicious people were walking around.” They lowered blinds, avoided windows, locked the front gate, and dispersed staff to other places across the city. The outlet was threatened and effectively locked down, but not torched. Pokharel hid his press ID. “ I never showed the ID card. Sometimes I had to enter the crowd shouting slogans, just to blend in among the protesters,” he said. He watched people fall under gunfire, and he helped pull one surrounded journalist out of a hostile crowd. Gaurav also contributed articles to international outlets as a freelancer. Later, while transcribing an interview of a young protest organizer, he wrote to his editor at an international outlet: “This was very hard to write. I cried many times while doing it.” He had been working at a stretch for days, battling bouts of exhaustion and low blood pressure. Protesters vandalized and set fire within the Singha Darbar complex housing Nepal Television and Radio Nepal. They tried to disrupt public broadcasting. Surendra Paudyal began the day with his press ID hanging on his neck, thinking it would let him move freely. But when he reached Singha Darbar around 3:30 pm, the situation felt dangerous. He put the ID in his pocket. When asked what mattered most, he answered without pause: life comes first. In that moment, he felt real fear and a strong duty to protect his team. His focus narrowed to basic things: stay calm, find exits, get everyone out safely. Later, they were able to keep the 8 pm news on air through a regional link. He felt mixed emotions and a sense of relief that the broadcast continued, but also sadness and anger that their own studio had come under attack.",

    "text": "By Bowel Diop Gender-based violence, including marital rape, occurs worldwide, and often, the perpetrators are the victim's husband. Marital rape is defined as an act in which one partner forces the other to engage in non-consensual sex. A report by Equality, a US-based organisation with offices in New York, Nairobi, and London, reveals that many women are affected by this phenomenon, including many in Africa. In private online forums where women post under anonymity, distressing testimonies emerge about the violence they suffer within relationships. Out of respect and for the protection of those sharing their stories, no names or platform details are revealed. Behind these testimonies emerges a chilling reality: that of sexual relations imposed within marriage without the woman’s consent, in other words, the reality of marital rape. As violence against women becomes increasingly common, consent is being trampled. The notion of “conjugal duty” still frequently outweighs a woman’s right to make decisions about her body. It is in these digital spaces, where distress is voiced and violence normalized, that discussion groups take shape, embodying a form of digital sisterhood. Providing room for listening, support, and open speech, these spaces enable women to challenge together the taboos that restrict their empowerment, online as well as offline. This safe space where women share their experiences underlines the urgency of an open and courageous debate on marital rape in Africa. A cultural, religious, and legal debate In May 2025, the program “Midi Plus” on TFM Télévision Futur Média, based in Senegal, gave national exposure to Oustaz Modou Fall, a Muslim authority in the country. This preacher claims that conjugal duty takes precedence over consent, thereby legitimizing sexual violence in the name of marriage. Speaking in Wolof, he stated: Gnouni loi bi néna sakh sa diabar so beugué teud akk mom té dacoroul daga ko violé . Pfff wakhi dof ! Sa diabar ga takk ko so farata Yallah akk souna Seydouna Mohamed , touki Pape Samba dem tournage soneu baye beugu dé gnibissi beugu teud ak sokhname gnouniko bouné dama soneu damadone fobéré (rires) ga forcéko viol le. Boudé lou amm la , lane moye texte bi. Si diné. People say the law declares that if you force your wife to have sex, that counts as rape. Pfff — absurd, this is your wife, the one you married before God. You travel, you work, Pape Samba [the host], you come back exhausted, you want to be with your wife, and she refuses. She says she’s tired, that she was doing the housework (laughter). So if you insist, it’s rape? If that’s the case, which religious scripture says so? We must be cautious about this. The broadcast immediately sparked indignation across social media. On TikTok, activists and legal experts mobilized. The Xam Sa Droit page published a series of videos challenging Modou Fall’s statements against existing legislation. Specifically, it points to Article 320 of Senegal’s Penal Code, which defines rape as any act of penetration “carried out through violence, coercion, threat or surprise.” This is a reminder that marriage does not take away any fundamental rights, and that refusing sex, even within a couple, remains an inalienable right. This effort at legal education was met with strong support on TikTok, as it put consent back at the center of the discussion. Voices were also raised on X. Nabou Diop Lo, a lawyer and activist for women’s and children’s rights, posted: Le viol tel que définit dans le code pénal Sénégalais ne fait pas une distinction entre le viol commis dans le ménage et celui commis hors des liens conjugaux. Tout ce qui compte c'est le consentement de la victime. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025 Rape, as defined in the Senegalese Penal Code, makes no distinction between rape committed within marriage and that committed outside it. What matters is the victim’s consent. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025 But how can a woman dare complain she's been raped when a religious figure claims that a wife’s “no” carries no weight? This dissonance between the law, public discourse, and women’s lived reality highlights the urgent need for legal reform and a clear stance from the authorities. By normalizing marital rape, this official rhetoric entrenches an absolute claim over women’s bodies and heavily compounds the moral weight borne by potential victims. Equality Now’s 2024 report shows that the legal recognition of marital rape differs significantly across Africa. The report notes that countries such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Madagascar, Senegal, and Togo explicitly criminalize marital rape. In countries including Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Tanzania, spouses are explicitly exempted from prosecution, except in exceptional cases. In Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mali, Uganda, and Chad, the law remains silent on the matter, creating a complete legal void. Senegalese law on rape and paedophilia, revised in 2020, sets out the definition of rape as follows: Tout acte de pénétration « commis par violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise ». Any act of penetration ‘committed by violence, coercion, threat, or surprise.’ However, the lack of clear legal provisions on marital rape and spousal consent creates a wide scope for interpretation, often to the detriment of the victim. As a result, marital rape is often treated as an ordinary form of domestic violence, rather than classified as a criminal offence. In Côte d’Ivoire, for example, an investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde published in February 2024 reported that a humorous TikTok video mocking women’s sexual fatigue sparked amused reactions — evidence that sexual non-consent is not taken seriously. According to figures published in African Health Sciences, 33 percent of women in Africa have been subjected to sexual violence at some point in their lives, with rates rising to 44 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Côte d’Ivoire, 40 percent of women housed in the shelter run by the NGO Akwaba Mousso say they have suffered marital rape. In many African legal systems, including in Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, the implicit presumption of consent between spouses prevents marital rape from being effectively recognised as a crime. When feminists raise awareness on the subject, the issue is frequently minimised. In the previously mentioned Le Monde article, Ivorian activist Marie-Paule Okri, co-founder of the Ivorian League for Women’s Rights, told the journalist: Quand on essaie d’en parler, on nous répond qu’on exagère. On nous inculque depuis l’adolescence que le corps de la femme est fait pour donner du plaisir à l’homme. When we try to talk about it, we are told we are exaggerating. From adolescence, we are taught that a woman’s body exists to give pleasure to men. Yet Article 14 of the Maputo Protocol commits African states to guaranteeing women’s fundamental rights, including health and reproductive consent. Beyond legislation, it will take a deep change in attitudes to improve women’s condition, grounded in respect for their bodies and equality in relationships.",

    "text": "On October 7, 2023, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), the group that governs the Palestinian territory of Gaza, breached the barrier that has surrounded the densely populated area for the last 16 years, preventing the free flow of people and goods. The militants then launched an attack on 22 nearby Israeli settlements, towns, and military bases, killing around 1,200 civilians and soldiers and taking at least 199 hostages. Many governments around the world have condemned the attack as a war crime and act of terror, while other governments blamed Israel for setting the stage for these attacks to take place. Since then, many governments have described Israel’s response as disproportionate: the official death toll now exceeds 40,000 Palestinians killed, including over 15,000 children — some experts estimate the actual number to be over four times higher. For more, read Global Voices’ previous Special Coverage: Israel’s war on Gaza The assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas Political Bureau, in Tehran on 31 July 2024, and a key Hezbollah military commander in Beirut on 30 July have significantly escalated tensions in the region. These targeted killings, combined with the failure to implement a ceasefire, are raising the risk of a war that could engulf the whole region, with potentially far-reaching consequences for global peace and stability. Israel’s actions, including its military occupation, settlement expansion, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and recurrent operations in Gaza and the West Bank, have drawn widespread accusations of human rights violations and defiance of international law. This includes an International Court of Justice (ICJ) initial ruling on an ongoing case finding it plausible that Israel is committing genocide and an application by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for arrest warrants against three Hamas leaders — including Haniyeh — and two Israeli officials — including Prime Minister Netanyahu — for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The arrest warrants include one for Mohammed Deif, Commander-in-Chief of Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. the Israeli army claims to have assassinated Deif in an airstrike on July 13 in the Al Mawasi humanitarian safe zone in Gaza — one that killed at least 90 people in a massacre described by United Nations official Scott Anderson as “some of the most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.” Israel's military operations and targeted assassinations in neighboring countries continue despite United Nations Security Council resolutions, global calls for a ceasefire, and repeated condemnations from international humanitarian organizations who have labeled them as violations of international humanitarian law. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached catastrophic levels, with an illegal blockade that has led to severe shortages of vital supplies and the threat of a poliovirus outbreak, exacerbating the suffering of the population, with nine out of 10 people internally displaced, many of them multiple times. The international community’s failure to enforce a ceasefire or hold Israel accountable has highlighted the limitations of global institutions in managing the crises. The United Nations has failed to mediate effectively, with its resolutions ignored, and global and regional players have not put pressure on Israel to accept or implement ceasefire resolutions adopted by the UNSC or proposed by mediators. This raises significant questions about the effectiveness of international law in protecting civilians in conflict zones. In this special coverage, we explore the regional and global implications as well as the challenges facing international law in addressing the ongoing crisis.",

    "text": "By Natalie Briggs When I first met Florence Warrick-Joseph, there were two things I didn’t know. One, we were related in that pumpkin vine way only Caribbean people can be. Two, the doubles I had just bought from her at a pop-up market had a surprise in them. It wasn’t the comforting warmth of a bara hot out of the box, leaking through greaseproof paper. It wasn’t the silken tear of teeth into that just-fried pillowy goodness, which, if you’re lucky, will still hold a hint of the crackle of oil. No, it wasn’t that. It was the filling. Cucumber, check. Sweet sauce, check. The heady bouquet of garlic, cumin and spices was there. But there was something different in the mouth feel. It wasn’t the melt-in-your-mouth consistency of the channa that makes doubles a national byword in Trinidad and Tobago. Tasty, yes … but different. The same bouquet is heavy in Warrick-Joseph’s small kitchen, tickling the nostrils, making me think about the last time I ate. “I don’t curry the peas. I stew it,” she revealed, while demonstrating how she puts her spin on the popular street food. This is not her only departure from the norm. The peas she uses? They are pigeon peas. These days, it isn’t quite the record scratch moment it was when it first appeared — but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. What we should be discussing is how pigeon peas, the stuff of pelau and coconut milk stew-downs, ended up in doubles. It started as an exhortation to think outside the box. In 2014, Warrick-Joseph, a retired registered nurse, decided to do an event management course. Her lecturer asked the cohort to stretch themselves beyond the ho-hummery of birthday parties and christenings for their practicum. She was an avid planter of pigeon peas, one of the many members of the Upper Cemetery Street Residents’ Association in Diego Martin, to do so. They had a bumper crop that year. “We were walking back down the hill,” Warrick-Joseph recalled. “Me, Errol [her husband] and Mr. Timothy. And he asked what were we going to do with all these peas. My husband said, ‘We will freeze it, we will sell it.’ Because that is what people do to get money to put in the organisation. So I said, thinking out of the box, we could have a pigeon peas festival.” The two men were sceptical. Warrick-Joseph continued, “They were like, ‘Nobody ever heard of a pigeon peas festival.’ I said, ‘I’ve heard of a mango festival. I’ve heard of a breadfruit festival. There’s a chocolate festival. Why not pigeon peas?’” The stage was set, but the main players were yet to arrive. They had the peas, but it would literally take a village to showcase their versatility. By the time the first festival rolled around in 2015, it was a result of a true community effort. They were able to generate so many recipes, including a version of doubles, that there were enough to fill a commemorative book. “We got someone to do pholourie,” Warrick-Joseph said. “We got somebody who could do pigeon peas accra. Everybody ended up taking a recipe. We found people in the community who could do these things. The pigeon peas roti was from a woman who did roti, and instead of using the dhal with the split peas, she used the pigeon peas.” Pholourie? Accra? Roti? It wasn’t such a stretch of the imagination. After all, pigeon peas’ nutty, earthy flavour lends itself well to a variety of savoury preparations. That’s why it’s a perennial favourite across the Caribbean. But Warrick-Joseph was about to hit me another curveball. That first festival, she came up with four of her own recipes. One for ice cream. One for a punch. One for a pigeon peas wine. Then one for a liqueur. Two of those are sweet. One of them officially qualifies as dessert. The trick was in picking, shelling and stewing the fresh pigeon peas to form the custard base all within 24 hours, while they were still full of flavour. My mind had more difficulty wrapping around the idea of pigeon peas as this creamy, cold concoction. There were no such problems with the muffins. As I stood and watched her prepare them, different scents filled the kitchen, this time with her signature spice blend. It was the spice, I realised, that gave it the illusion of being sweet. I hadn’t seen her put a lot of sugar into the mixture. The eventual result was dense, reminding me more of a coconut drop than the traditional muffin with its cakey crumb. Fresh out of the oven, breaking into one was a treat; I could smell the spices wafting up from the steamy centre. There was nutmeg. Some cinnamon, too. Nothing in the flavour screamed pigeon peas. That was more in the texture and the solidity with which it sat in my stomach. One muffin felt like a full meal, which led me to ask about the nutritional benefits of the pigeon peas substitution. I found out that, among other things, they were high in potassium and fibre, and were good for gut flora, diabetics, and women who wanted to lose weight. In fact, it was trying to cater to customers who wanted healthier alternatives to doubles that prompted Warrick-Joseph to come up with a recipe for gluten-free bara, made with pigeon pea flour: “The reason for the switch was that people felt they wanted gluten-free. There was a group of people that was intolerant to normal flour.” These were what I had really come to see her prepare, the muffins being a delectable side journey. I knew it would be different from the first doubles I had from her, since the bara in that one had been made the regular way, with flour, leavening agent and oil. How different this version would be, both in taste and feel, was left to be seen. It was a three-flour mix, including the ground pigeon peas, which resulted in a tacky, sticky sort of dough that was allowed to rest for about half an hour. While it did that, Warrick-Joseph warmed the oil in which she would fry them later, and prepared the pigeon peas filling. We talked about many things while she did this, including her business and her plans to eventually have pre-packaged products in the supermarket. When she deemed the dough ready, she put the peas aside. The low gluten content made it difficult to handle as it tears easily, which is why she prefers to use a pastelle press to shape them, instead of rolling them out the traditional way. From there, the perfect circles went into the warmed oil, where they puff up slightly — nothing like the regular bara, because of the low gluten content. By the time they are done, I’m itching to try them. Warrick-Joseph presented them to me on a plate, complete with pigeon peas filling, cucumber and a tangy tamarind sweet sauce. I took a bite, and chewed slowly, trying to make up my mind about them. The verdict? All the elements were there. This tasted like doubles. Purists might draw the line at the bara, which was more reminiscent of a soft taco shell — flatter, with a slight, mealy crunch to it — while health enthusiasts might hail it as the thing to make doubles great again.",

    "text": "Exile Hub is one of Global Voices’ partners in Southeast Asia, emerging in response to the 2021 coup in Myanmar, focusing on empowering journalists and human rights defenders. This edited article is republished under a content partnership agreement. Most people spend their lives running away from danger. Esther ran toward it. After finding refuge in Australia under UNHCR protection, she made the bold decision to return to the Thailand–Myanmar border in 2023 to continue her journalism. Now, in 2025, she reports from one of Myanmar’s most dangerous conflict zones often under fire, often uncertain of tomorrow. Yet she remains unshaken. In a world where silence is safe, Esther chooses the frontline. Her weapon is truth, and she wields it for those who cannot. A journey against the current Born in Mon State in 1993, Esther has always been someone who could not ignore injustice. “I have never been able to lie to myself or live in misery. If something doesn’t sit right with me, I have to face it head-on,” she reflects. Like many young people in Myanmar, Esther initially wandered through different jobs, unsure of her calling. She translated movies, worked as a travel and tour sales representative, and later became a public relations officer at a Korean company. But none of these roles felt right. “I couldn’t stay where I felt trapped or compromised,” she shares. Her turning point came in 2018 when she attended a basic journalism course. “That’s when I realized writing and sharing opinions was what I had always loved. It felt like home.” After the course ended, she landed her first journalism job at an ethnic media house. When the coup changed everything By 2021, Esther was working with a major media house. When the coup hit, her newsroom relocated to Karenni State, and Esther went with them, continuing to report under dangerous conditions. But even after escaping to Australia for safety, the pull of truth was stronger than comfort. In 2023, she made the decision to return. A few months after she arrived in Thailand, the military made a desperate announcement. In February 2024, the military reactivated its conscription law, mandating that men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 serve in the army. Evading service or helping someone evade could lead to five years in prison. “As the number of these conscription stories grew, so did my determination to report them,” Esther recalls. But working as an exiled independent journalist came with its own struggles. With no regular income and the constant need for resources, continuing her work was a challenge. That’s when she applied for Exile Hub’s Critical Voices Fellowship 2024 and received it. Bearing witness on the frontlines Esther began collecting stories from those most affected. She spoke with young men who had fled their villages, fearful of being conscripted. She also interviewed women who had watched brothers and husbands taken by the army, leaving families uncertain and anxious about their loved ones’ fate. In September 2024, she published “I Don’t Want Others to Face What I Faced: Stories of Forced Military Conscription,” giving a voice to those the regime wanted silenced. Later, she followed with another hard-hitting piece, “Snatched from Their Beds, Taken on the Streets — The Young Men in Myanmar Forced to Fight the Junta’s Losing War.” Today, Esther works deep inside one of Myanmar’s most volatile conflict zones, a place where the sound of gunfire and the threat of airstrikes are constant. Despite the risks, she is satisfied with witnessing the truth with her eyes and documenting and reporting on it. Esther is more than a journalist. She is a lifeline for those whose cries would otherwise vanish in the dark. And no matter the risk, she will keep writing and keep reporting, because for her, silence is never an option.",

    "text": "Environmental groups initiated global activities and protests from September 18 to 21 to drumbeat the call for urgent climate action amid the worsening pollution and continuing deterioration of the natural ecosystem. The series of protests were held right before the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and less than six weeks away from the UN Climate Summit (COP30) in Brazil. In Asia, the “Draw the Line” campaign highlighted the demand to phase out fossil fuels, build renewables, shift to sustainable food, and prioritize the people’s basic needs over corporate interests. Several countries participated in the campaign led by a network of environmental groups and community-based organizations. In the Philippines, the campaign was actively supported by local groups resisting projects and policies that threaten the lives and livelihoods of rural and coastal communities. A fluvial protest was organized in the town of Culasi in Antique province, located in the Visayas islands of the Philippines, to call attention to the demand of the small fisherfolk against the entry of commercial fishing operations in municipal waters. Javie Barcinal of 350.org Asia echoed the stand of small fishers. Small fishers are among the worst affected by the climate crisis, with warming seas resulting in dwindling catches each year. To make matters worse, the government has allowed industrial fishing to encroach into municipal waters. This exacerbates climate injustice that small fishers experience as hunger for their families. In Indonesia, environmnetalists organized at least 36 actions in 34 cities and provinces across the country on September 18, to push for bold reforms in government policies. A march was held towards the State Palace on September 19 as rallyists reiterated the anti-corruption demands of the youth-led protests that erupted in the country last month. Sisilia Nurmala Dewi of 350.org Indonesia led climate advocates in asserting an end to corruption to fund a better future. We draw the line as flash floods drown the innocent, while people’s voices against government failures are being silenced. Oligarchs and polluters have ruled this country for far too long, taking public money for climate action and destroying natural resources that should be preserved for future generations. We demand real, decisive action. President Prabowo must honor his promises by committing to 100 percent renewable energy in 10 years and a clear immediate plan to phase-out coal plants. Paskah Toga of Climate Rangers Bali cited the recent flooding disaster in Bali island to rally public opposition against fossil-based power plants. The recent deadly floods in Bali is clear evidence that the climate crisis is no longer a distant threat but a reality that needs to be resolved with concrete policies. The government must stop building fossil-based power plants and phase out fossil fuels. In Japan, protesters challenged the new leadership to phase out fossil fuels and to reverse policies that blame immigrants for the country’s social woes. Masayoshi Iyoda, 350.org Japan campaigner, summed up their demand. We draw the line on Japan’s rising contributions to climate chaos and war. As we experience both flash floods and extreme heat, workers suffer and food prices continue to soar. Japan’s new leadership must show political will to phase out fossil fuels and shift to 100% renewables, instead of going with the far-right tide of blaming immigrants for our economic woes and backsliding on climate action. The protest was also attended by activists who expressed solidarity with Palestinians by condemning the continuous bombings and military attacks in Gaza. In South Korea, Jiyun Gim of the Green Environment Youth Korea urged authorities to comply with the planned emissions reduction this year. South Korea’s 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) will be determined in November. We are drawing the line to prevent South Korea from setting a climate goal that falls below 60% emissions reduction. This is not just about numbers—it is the survival line for future generations. The government must set ambitious, science-based, and future-oriented climate targets. In Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh, community residents staged an action denouncing the planned revival of a coal plant. Shahrukh Karim, a youth leader in Matarbari, articulated the sentiments of the local community. We are burning, our lands are dying, and our rivers are drying up. We draw the line on building another coal plant, when the existing one has already driven away thousands of families and turned our homes into a wasteland. This needs to stop. Communities Draw the Line on Matarbari Coal Plant 2 Revival https://t.co/2IT1VPkF5P pic.twitter.com/9E05xBK9xV — Energy & Power (@enpbd) September 20, 2025 In an email interview with Global Voices, 350.org Asia Communications Manager Ilang-Ilang Quijano shared their initial plans on how to sustain the campaign.",

    "text": "Over 6,000 delegates gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, for the second Africa Climate Summit (ACS2), held from September 8 to 10, to search for Africa-driven solutions ahead of negotiations for the United Nations 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the world's largest annual environmental conference. The second Africa Climate Summit was organized to unite African leaders, youth, and partners in pushing for fair climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s role as a solutions hub, while preparing a common position ahead of COP30 negotiations. It was a pivotal moment for Africa to stake its claim as a leader in the global climate conversation. Leaders, activists, and young innovators came together to push for reforms in climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s youth voices. The gathering was themed around “Accelerating Global Climate Solutions: Financing for Africa’s Resilient and Green Development.” Ethiopia’s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, opened the event with a keynote that set the tone: Africa should not be seen only as a victim of climate challenges, but as a continent of solutions and innovations that could guide the world forward. He also proposed the “Africa Climate Innovation Compact” to produce 1,000 innovators by 2030, financed and owned by Africans. This vision was built on the momentum of the inaugural summit in Nairobi in 2023, which, importantly, was preceded by the African Youth Climate Assembly (AYCA). By doing so, organizers ensured that the majority-youth population of Africa was not just represented but central to shaping the conversation. The challenges Africa faces Africa continues to wrestle with the painful legacy of historical injustice and the harsh reality of a deepening climate crisis. Despite contributing the least to global emissions, the continent feels the impacts most acutely. Climate finance remains painfully inadequate as wealthy nations have consistently fallen short of their yearly pledge, and African countries today pay back about five times more in debt servicing than they receive in climate aid. The cost of this imbalance is causing hospitals to stretch beyond capacity as diseases like malaria and cholera spread more widely under shifting climatic conditions. Crops are failing under the weight of prolonged droughts or sudden floods, leaving farmers with empty fields and families without food. Coastal cities, from Lagos to Dar es Salaam, face rising waters that sweep away homes, businesses, and livelihoods. Yet at the same time, Africa holds some of the richest renewable resources on the planet. If harnessed, its solar capacity alone could power the world many times over. Africa holds 17 percent of the world’s population but receives just 3 percent of global climate investment. Restrictive financial systems and predatory loan arrangements often force African countries back into reliance on fossil fuels. EcoVista, a youth-led ecological justice movement whose main focus is on climate justice and the environment, based in Nairobi, Kenya posted on its X account: Fossil fuels are the biggest driver of the climate crisis, responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. #MakeThemPay Draw The Line pic.twitter.com/N9aUDWl8e8 — EcoVistaKe (@EcoVistaKE) September 19, 2025 Layered on top of that is a painful reminder of colonial history. While Africa’s minerals powered industrial growth in the Global North, the continent was left behind with ecological damage and struggling economies. Yearly natural disasters including cyclones, floods, and expanding deserts displace millions every year, and pushed African leaders at ACS2 to adopt the Addis Ababa Declaration, a clear and urgent call for change. With regard to the consequences facing Africa, Tangwa Abilu, a Cameroonian Climate and Environmental Activist, shared on X : The horn of Africa is grieving because their -Their farms are no longer yielding -Advancement of desert is alarming -Our major rivers are drying -Proliferation of pest and pathogens -Development of tropical diseases. -Our crop are dieing out. Climate change is a reality. pic.twitter.com/2MQ5fZG1Zo — Tangwa Abilu.🌿🌏🌾🍀🍃.SDG's. (@AbiluTangwa) December 29, 2024 In the same context, K. Diallo, an African author, drew attention to the damage caused by floods in December 2023. He posted on his X account: flood disaster in the DR Congo is a result of global warming meeting a failed state…..The global South bears more than 95% of the costs and deaths related to climate change despite making up less than 5% of consumption-based cumulative emissions above 350ppm CO2. pic.twitter.com/vTDobNNVl5 — K.Diallo ☭ (@nyeusi_waasi) December 31, 2023 Demands ahead of COP30 For African leaders, climate finance must shift from symbolic promises to meaningful reparations. They argue that financing should come as debt-free grants rather than loans that deepen dependency. Historic polluters owe this to frontline communities losing their farms to drought or their homes to rising seas. The Loss and Damage Fund, in particular, needs to prioritize these vulnerable communities with direct, rapid assistance: cash for families in sinking villages, support for starved farmlands, and investment in healthcare for climate-induced trauma. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said: Too often, Africa's story begins with what we lack: finance, technology, time. Let us instead begin with what we have: the youngest population in the world, vast solar resources, and the resilience to build a new climate economy. Leaders are also demanding stronger commitments from rich nations. During last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries from the global north pledged to pay USD300 billion in climate finance, but the amount falls far short of the USD1.3 trillion per year needed by African nations, who need it to effectively adapt and transition away from fossil fuels. ACS2 came at a crucial moment when the Lake Chad Basin, which once supported millions across Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic, had shrunk by over 90 percent. With it, the livelihoods of countless families have evaporated. Africa is both the most vulnerable to climate collapse and one of the most promising centers for climate solutions. As the world heads towards COP30 in Brazil in November, Africans say they do not just want to be heard, but are demanding to be recognized as solution builders and shapers of the planet’s shared future.",

    "text": "Yu Kongjian (俞孔坚), 62, the Chinese landscape architect who pioneered the concept of “sponge cities,” died in a plane crash in the Pantanal region, the largest tropical wetland in the world, in Brazil, on September 23, 2025. Three other people also died during the accident: pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, and filmmakers Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., who were both working with Yu to create a documentary about sponge cities. The cause of the crash is under investigation. Ferraz’s work focused on nonfiction productions, including a series about the 2016 plane crash involving the Brazilian football team, Chapecoense. Crispim Jr. worked on projects such as a documentary about Brazilian architect Vilanova Artigas and another about the first women’s football national team in Brazil. Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, posted condolences on his X account and highlighted Yu's work: Foi com tristeza e consternação que recebi a notícia do desastre aéreo ocorrido no Pantanal no início da noite desta terça-feira, 23. A tragédia, infelizmente, custou as vidas do piloto Marcelo Pereira de Barros, dos documentaristas Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz e Rubens… — Lula (@LulaOficial) September 24, 2025 It was with sadness and consternation that I received the news about the aircraft disaster that happened in the Pantanal regional, early Tuesday night, the 23rd. The tragedy, unfortunately, took the lives of the pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, documentarians Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., and the Chinese architect Kongjian Yu. In times of climate change, Kongjian Yu became a world reference for sponge cities, which unite life quality and environment protection: something we want — and need — for the future. To all the victims’ friends, family and coworkers, I leave my deepest sorrows. Yu’s legacy Yu was in Brazil to work on a documentary, but he had also recently attended the São Paulo International Architecture Biennale, which was themed “EXTREMES — Architectures for an overheated planet.” Raquel Schenkman, the Institute of Brazilian Architects’ president, responsible for the Biennale’s organization, told G1 Yu was “someone on the frontline of transformations in big urban centers facing climate change.” On its website, the Biennale published a note saying that, as the “creator of the theory of sponge cities, Yu Kongjian left a monumental legacy, also urgent to face climate crisis in cities,” and that his work, based on ecosystemic principles, “showed in a practical and poetic way how the landscape can be a vital infrastructure to urban resilience, integrating man to nature in a sustainable way.” Sponge cities concept Yu’s main legacy is designing and implementing projects based on his sponge cities theory. A professor at Peking University, his “sponge city” concept became a top national priority in China in 2013, following the massive floods in the Beijing region in 2012, which left 79 people dead and tens of thousands displaced. He also founded Turenscape, one of the main landscape architecture firms in the world, based in China. Yu cautioned against overly “grey” cities that rely too much on concrete and asphalt, which disrupt natural water pathways and prevent the ground from absorbing water. While conventional water management focuses on draining water through engineered drainage infrastructure, such as pipes and water channels, sponge cities rely on techniques such as green roofs, rainwater storage and infiltration systems, sunken green spaces, permeable pavement, bioretention ponds, wetland revitalization, restoring natural waterflow pathways, and more. “Floods are not enemies,” Yu explained in an interview with WeForum. “We can make friends with floods. We can make friends with water.” Yu’s approach to urban planning has been successfully implemented in dozens of cities in China, particularly after Chinese President Xi Jinping established his thoughts on ecological civilization in 2018. In the past decade, his natural landscape approach is becoming an important tool in city planning and water management around the world. In Southeast Asia, where recurring extreme weather events routinely cause massive floods that displace hundreds of thousands, many city planners are looking to sponge cities as a potential solution for unprecedented levels of rainfall. So far, the concept has mostly been implemented on a small scale in individual neighborhoods, streets, or areas, meaning its flood mitigation impacts are often limited to the local level, rather than city- or nationwide. On X, Zhongshan city's tourism promotion outlet, commemorates Yu's death by highlighting one of his landscape projects in the southern Chinese city: On September 23 (Brazilian time), Professor Yu Kongjian from the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at #Peking University, tragically passed away in a plane crash at the age of 62. Professor Yu had won numerous world-class #design awards, including the Oberlander Prize and the John Cobb Common Good Award. Among his representative works is the #QijiangPark in #Zhongshan, #Guangdong . This #park, transformed from the site of a former shipyard, opened in 2001 and quickly gained global attention, winning several domestic and international design awards. In designing and building the park, Professor Yu and his team preserved the original industrial relics, such as shipyard machinery, docks, and other structures, and repurposed them with new functions. [original English version from @Amzhongshan] Yu himself acknowledged that scaling up the pilot projects in Chinese cities was challenging. One of his sponge city projects in Zhengzhou faced backlash after a severe flood in 2021, which claimed 12 lives in the city, prompting many to express doubts about the practicality of his idea. Moreover, as China's coastal regions are highly industrialized, they demand cross-departmental collaboration, strong political will, and extensive administrative coordination to restore concrete riverbanks and seawalls to wetlands. In an interview with Brazilian news outlet G1, Yu said that on a scale of 1 to 10, his optimism regarding the world’s chances of reversing climate change ranked 4. He also mentioned water scarcity — one of the challenges his projects aimed to address — as the primary issue humanity will face over the next 25 years. A journalist living in China, Isabela Shi, shared Yu Kongjian’s last update on a Chinese social media platform: 🕯️No último vídeo que o arquiteto chinês Yu Kongjian divulgou na rede social chinesa, ele estava mostrando a viagem a Pantanal com equipa brasileira que tenta refletir sobre Planeta Esponja através de encolhimento de zonas húmidas. “Wonderful, amazing”, encantou ele pro Brasil. pic.twitter.com/fKn5ZKgIwe — Isabela Shi🇨🇳🇧🇷 (@ShiIsabela) September 25, 2025",

    "text": "This article by Adin Kadrić first appeared in Balkan Diskurs on September 12, 2025. An edited version is being republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement with the Post-Conflict Research Center (PCRC). Editor's note: Zenica is a city in the middle of Bosnia and Herzegovina with about 100,000 residents. It is noted for its ironworks industry as well as being home to one of the big prisons in ex-Yugoslavia, described in the cult rock song Zenica Blues. It is not often considered when speaking about art, making the significance of this initiative — which began during the war of 1992-1995 and still persists to this day — even more extraordinary. For over 30 years, the Zenica School of Comics has been not only an illustration school but a symbol of perseverance, cultural resistance, and lasting dedication to art. Initially conceived as an escape from the repression of the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and later, a platform for expression and creativity, the school has trained around 200 young artists. About 70 of them have gone on to become prominent young authors, whose works have left a mark on the domestic and regional comics scene. Several graduates are even acclaimed beyond the borders of their country, with Kenan Halilović, Biljana Šafaražik, and Zdravko Cvjetković being some of the most prominent. While the school has been synonymous with quality and creativity within the domestic comic scene for years, the international acclaim for these artists’ work underscores the fact that Zenica maintains a firm foothold in this visual medium. Recalling its beginnings, Adnadin Jašarević, the school’s founder and director of the Zenica City Museum, said that its primary goal was to give children a creative escape from the harsh realities of war. Under such conditions, comics were like Alice in Wonderland — providing an escape from hunger, fear, and shelling. An average of ten students still pass through the school every year, learning how to translate their thoughts, fears, and hopes into dynamic sequences of frames and speech clouds. Newer names like Filip Andronik, Milorad Vicanović, Senad Mavrić, and Enis Čišić represent the contemporary wave of comic artists from BiH. They actively cooperate with renowned publishers from the United States and Europe, demonstrating that despite its underdeveloped infrastructure, Bosnia and Herzegovina has comic creators who can stand equally alongside the best talent the genre has to offer. Publications such as “Horostop,” “ZE strip,” “EKO strip” and “SUV – Steps in Time” were created at the Zenica School, showcasing both its longevity and its dedication to comic culture. Explaining that the students themselves choose the topics they work on according to their own interests, Jašarević noted that he has “never stopped working” to ensure that comics remain a tool for expression and creative release. As far as technology’s impact on the comic industry goes, Jašarević explained that while comics used to be widely available to the masses, they are now becoming a far more exclusive product, with expensive integral editions and albums intended for a small but loyal audience. While the idea behind ​​comics as a liberating medium remains the same, the development of technology has heralded a turn in modern-day comic production. Cartoonist and former Zenica student Zdravko Cvjetković, in speaking about the impact of technology, emphasized that smart tablets have made drawing easier and faster for many artists, without compromising the quality of their work. However, he warned that AI tools — such as those used for generating text and images — pose serious ethical and aesthetic questions. He believes that the mass availability of tools that produce images and stories in seconds, threatens to trivialize art and blur the line between creativity and automation: “If we all become artists just because we have a tool in our pocket, then nobody is really an artist.” Many things about comics today, according to Cvjetković, are drastically different than before the war: “Comics are no longer accessible to such a wide audience, especially children. They’re too expensive and rarely found in newsstands.” The burgeoning Bosnian comics scene Pointing out that children today reach for screens before print media like comics or books, Cvjetković said that publishers are therefore targeting older generations who grew up with comics. A positive outcome of this is the growing number of comics festivals in the region, which promote a culture of reading and drawing. “Workshops and comics contests for children [are] an almost mandatory part of every serious festival,” Cvjetković emphasized, “and this is crucial in the absence of comics schools like the one in Zenica.” Comics culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina persists despite its modest ecosystem, in which there is almost no institutional support, and few major publishers or specialized festivals. However, thanks to the enthusiasm of individuals, the scene is not disappearing; in fact, it is quietly but steadily growing. Authors like Berin Tuzlić and Enis Čišić have been representing BiH on the regional and international comics scene for years. Tuzlić, known for his experimental approach and multimedia projects, combines comics with music and animation. Čišić, who also tried his hand at Marvel productions, represents a more contemporary, technically precise form of expression. Their work shows that the country is producing talent capable of competing globally. Ismet Erdić also holds a special place on the BiH comics scene, with his rare combination of historical storytelling and visual narration in comics about Kulin Ban and medieval Bosnia. His work has educational value and is often used in classrooms, which makes him one of the few authors whose comics reach the general public. Despite unfavorable conditions for comic distribution, publicity, and marketing, comics culture in BiH is still preserved as a niche interest by enthusiasts. Social networks, web comics, and regional cooperation with authors from Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia are currently key to their survival. So, while relatively small, the BiH comics scene has an authentic flair and great potential, waiting for better times ahead.",

    "text": "In Togo, a national initiative built on civic solidarity helps relieve parents’ yearly back-to-school expenses. Education is free and compulsory throughout the country, with a population of over 9.5 million. Following a two-month break (from mid-July to mid-September), more than 3 million students returned to school this month. While the authorities continue to work on improving education through teacher training and recruitment, investing in renovations and school infrastructure, the parents’ main priority is seeing their children succeed at the end of each school year. Over the years, there has been a marked increase in the gross enrollment rate and the proportion of Togolese students completing the school year. In April 2025, the local news website Lechiquier published: …le taut brut de scolarisation au primaire dépasse 100%. Il était de l’ordre de 111,70% en 2023, 116,70% en 2024 et une prévision de 116,20% pour l’année 2025. Dans le même sillage, le taux d’achèvement du primaire a évolué de 88,80% en 2023 à 94,60% en 2024. Pour l’année 2025, le gouvernement table sur une augmentation de 121,70%. The gross primary school enrolment rate now exceeds 100 percent. In 2023, it was approximately 111.70 percent, in 2024 it was 116.70 percent, and 116.20 percent is forecast for 2025. Similarly, the primary school completion rate increased from 88.80 percent in 2023 to 94.60 percent in 2024. For 2025, the government forecasts an increase to 121.70 percent. This rate of over 100 percent is due to it far exceeding the initial estimated value. Free school education Togo is one of five African countries with high enrollment rates in school, an impressive development stemming from the various reforms the authorities have implemented in the education sector. In 2008, Togo introduced free pre-school and primary education in the public sector. Since the beginning of the 2021–2022 school year, education in public secondary schools has also been free, a measure the authorities will maintain for the 2025–2026 school year. These measures help combat inequities in accessing education. However, efforts, such as providing student school kits (notebooks, books, pens, pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, and school bags), are still required to tackle inequality and ensure universal coverage. Togo’s guaranteed monthly minimum wage (SMIG) increased from FCFA 35,000 (USD 64) in 2012 to FCFA 52,500 (USD 95) in early 2023. Although this measure was introduced to support the Togolese working population of over 4 million, not all are content with its implementation, condemning the country’s ongoing poor economic situation and challenging living conditions. Association contributions Given the financial crisis, parents’ biggest concern is purchasing back-to-school supplies and kits. However, Togolese civil society provides solutions. Citizens, both young and old, are quick to lend their support to help parents meet these expenses. Numerous citizens, working as part of various associations, travel to the country’s villages and remote areas, assisting and supporting children, especially the most vulnerable. These efforts are a social and solidarity-based alternative to the associations committed to child protection, education, and development. One example is Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (the Togolese Child Protection Association or LTPE). On August 29, 2025, LTPE supported 5,000 children from 12 villages of the Amou Prefecture in the Plateaux region. Le 29 août 2025, plus de 5 000 enfants de la préfecture d’Amou venus de 12 localités différentes ont reçu des kits scolaires grâce à l’initiative « Éducation pour tous : 1 élève, 1 kit, 1 choix de vie » portée par la #LTPE. pic.twitter.com/LMroVuE9oY — Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (@LTPE_ONG) August 30, 2025 On August 29, 2025, more than 5,000 children from 12 different locations in the Amou Prefecture received school kits through the #LTPE initiative ‘Education for All: One student, one kit, one life choice.’ In an interview with Togolese media outlet Plume d'Afrique, Nina Afi Kazoulé, the LTPE coordinator, explained the scope of this measure: Nous voulons par cette action éviter le décrochage scolaire. Et nous savons que le décrochage scolaire peut être dû à l'incapacité financière des parents, aux grossesses en milieu scolaire, bref à tous les comportements qui ne sont pas appropriés à adopter par un apprenant. We want to prevent school dropouts with this measure. We know that school dropouts can happen due to the parents’ lack of financial resources, pregnancies among school girls, or any inappropriate student behavior In the village of Zooti N'titikope, Vogan, a town 45 kilometers northwest of the Togolese capital Lomé, the Togovi Bé Sourire association and Action for Peace and Good Governance (APGG) joined forces with several other associations on September 5 and 6 to support young learners. More than 300 vulnerable children received school kits, and 20 young girls will be monitored and supported in successfully reintegrating into school. Lomé also has vulnerable children supported by other groups, including the Premiers Pas pour l’Enfance (First Steps for Children or 3PE) association. Its mission is to promote equal education opportunities through solidarity initiatives, such as the payment of school fees and supply provision for children. Association President Akilou Demon told media outlet Ledefenseur: Nous voulons que tous les enfants aient accès à l’éducation, car l’enfant a droit à l’école. Si certains en sont privés, ce n’est pas juste. Notre ambition est de leur donner une chance égale de réussir et de contribuer demain au développement de notre patrie. As children have the right to attend school, we want all children to have access to education. Some are deprived, and this is not fair. We aim to give them equal opportunities to succeed and one day contribute to our country’s development. Although the results of various reforms are visible, shortcomings remain in Togo’s education system. School infrastructure, such as classrooms, is substandard, especially in villages. Students study in straw huts with few school benches (supplemented in some places with bricks) and are forced to move or interrupt their lessons due to adverse weather conditions. In 2021, these circumstances led to construction plans for 30,000 classrooms equipped with wooden class benches. However, in September 2024, the government reduced its improvement projects by more than half, going from 30,000 classrooms to just 14,632. While civil society can offset some of the education system’s shortcomings, it’s ultimately up to the state, which declared education free and compulsory, to improve education quality and train new teachers to achieve equal opportunities for all Togolese children.",

    "text": "This article, written by Artur Ferreira and Amanda Oliveira, was originally published on May 30, 2025, on the Agência Mural website. An edited version is published on Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement. In the collective imagination, the Romani people are associated with colourful clothing, parties, accessories, and an aura of mystery, embodying a wandering spirit. But beyond the stereotypes, there is a rich history of resistance and belonging that spans centuries, including in Brazil, in the outskirts of São Paulo. In universities, public offices, doctors’ offices, or their traditional campsites, they are fighting for their rights, against prejudice, and for recognition in a country where there are still shortcomings in caring for the diversity of these communities. In Itaim Paulista, a neighbourhood at the eastern end of the city, 250 people live in one of the main and oldest Romani campsites in the region. “Some Romanies palm read, dance, get dressed up in traditional clothing, but some are even evangelical, like myself, and they don’t all even live in camps. We are a people like any other,” the 32-year-old housewife Magda Santos says. She has been living in the camps for eight years with her husband and two children. “I am not Romani by blood, but I became one when I got married to one.” The Romani, also known as the Roma peoples, are an ethnic group that doesn’t have a single origin. One of the more widely accepted theories is that they are of Indian origin but have travelled the world since the 11th century in a great diaspora, dispersing throughout the Balkans, Western Europe, and later to other continents. While she was hanging clothes on the clothesline, 29-year-old seamstress Viviane Alves Pereira made sure to find an answer when asked about the main problems her people face. The statement came without hesitation: prejudice, invisibility and the lack of access to basic rights, a common scenario in marginalized neighbourhoods. Who are the Roma people from the outskirts? The majority of Romani who live on the outskirts of Greater São Paulo are of the Calon ethnicity, like Magda and Viviane. They are also those who suffer the most prejudice relating to maintaining their traditions and being most recognized as “gypsies” (a term now considered derogatory), because of their clothing and their nomadic lifestyle, according to sources from this report. In Brazil, there are two other Romani ethnic groups: the Roma and the Sinti peoples. They don’t wear traditional clothing, so they mostly go unnoticed in the cities. “Many Brazilians were already cared for by doctors, nurses and Romani lawyers, and maybe they don’t even know,” states activist Nicolas Ramanush, 64, who is the president of the NGO, Romani Embassy of Brazil (Embaixada Cigana do Brasil), in Santo André in the Greater São Paulo area. “In the region, Romani people were concentrated in the neighborhood of Itaim Paulista and in the cities of Itaquaquecetuba and Itapevi, with camps near the train stations,” he says. Each ethnicity is divided into subgroups, and each one develops its own customs, habits, religions and rituals. “In my ethnic group, for example, we always wear decorated shoes with a lot of details. Some Calon women are famous for their flowery dresses and for using handkerchiefs,” says Ramanush, who belongs to the Sinti ethnicity. This group has the fewest number of people in the country. “Today, if there are 100 families in Brazil, it is a lot,” says Ramanush. “This is because of the period of Nazism. The Sintis were almost exterminated. Among the Romani killed during the Holocaust, the majority were Sinti and Roma,” he adds. Ramanush notes that many aspects of Romani culture are integrated into the Brazilian lifestyle without most people realizing it. They were among those responsible for helping Carnival to grow, especially in the northeast, creating Carnival street blocks. Certain costumes, such as “La Ursa” (The Bear) in Recife, have a Romani origin. “Instruments like the seven or six-string guitar were brought to Brazil by the Roma people. Some samba dancers spoke about how living with the Romanies inspired them musically,” Ramanush says. Under the canvas tents Nomadic and outskirt-dwelling Romani have a routine defined by difficulties surrounding education for their children and lack of healthcare, caused by the lack of a stable address. They also face São Paulo’s structural problems, such as floods, and living under canvas tents, without safety. One of the most impactful natural disasters was the flooding in February 2025 in the far east of São Paulo, in the region known as Jardim Pantanal. The streets and houses remained underwater for several days. The Romani in these camps had to face that situation under the tents. “We spent days underwater, and it was the neighbors from the region who helped us,” Santos remembers with outrage. The camp’s inhabitants had to deal with a lack of drinking water; tents were affected, and according to local accounts, they had to make a joint effort to avoid major losses of furniture and appliances while the flooding advanced. Just like Santos, Ramanush believes that the first step to improving the Romani community’s life in the outskirts of Brazil is for them not to be invisible. Prejudice and invisibility Even with initiatives such as the National Day of Roma Peoples, commemorated every May 24 since 2006, some rights are still neglected. For example, Romani people are not recognized in the national census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Santos remembers the difficulty she faced in registering her children’s ethnic group in their identity documents. Since there is no official recognition of “Romani” ethnicity, she ended up registering them by their skin color. “There are policies catered to Indigenous peoples, Black and Brown people, but not for Romani people. We have our own culture, but we do not show up, which is why I say being Romani is being invisible,” she claims. Ramanush experienced a similar situation when a census taker visited him during the most recent census in Brazil in 2022. “She asked me what my race was, and I answered that it was not on the list. My complexion is white, but I’m a Romani.” IBGE estimates that Brazil has between 800,000 and a million Romani, but the Roma groups believe the numbers are higher. “I've already travelled all over Brazil meeting Romani people from all ethnic groups. Without official data, there are no efficient public policies,” Ramanush explains. “Even to count how many Romani there are in each city or town, local governments make the process difficult.” Besides the lack of recognition, Romani people living in peripheral areas also face a prejudice that runs through generations. They have been accused of theft, robbery, and deception for centuries. It wasn’t rare to have them associated with kidnapping children. Trying to change this reality and fight prejudice, Romani groups have been mobilized for the approval of a bill making teaching Romani culture and history in schools mandatory — modeling what already happens with Black and Indigenous people in Brazil. The proposal presented by federal deputy Helder Salomão (PT, Workers’ Party), at the Chamber of Deputies as Bill 3547 of 2015, has made little progress. In their justification, the text reinforces the idea that for centuries Romani groups have been experiencing prejudice, marginalization, exclusion and persecution. So, the bill aims to “change the image of Romani populations, trying to reduce prejudice and discrimination that these groups are subjected to.” The bill also asserts that providing visibility for Romani groups “will provide a more fertile ground to build public policies focusing on the promotion of human rights.”",

    "text": "This article was published by Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand. An edited version has been republished by Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement. Between July and May 2025, tensions between Thailand and Cambodia over a border dispute devolved into violence that left at least 43 dead on both sides, dozens injured, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Despite signing a ceasefire agreement on July 28, hostility has remained deeply embedded in both countries, fueled by misinformation. Amidst the turmoil, Cambodians and Thais have come together to launch a cross-border campaign aimed at combating hatred and promoting empathy and lasting peace. Thailand and Cambodia share over 700 kilometres of border, where several undemarcated sections have been long-standing sources of conflict between the two countries, since the Preah Vihear dispute beginning in the 1950s, to this year when clashes broke out on May 28th and led to fatalities on July 24th. On top of that, the countries also share historical and cultural ties, which have complicated the tensions between them, leading to deep-rooted hostility between the two peoples. Hostility skyrocketed after the July 24 armed conflict as the conflict between the two governments trickled down to all facets of society. Cambodian and Thai netizens traded accusations on who initiated the clashes. “We see all the problems start to unfold, and when hatreds, prejudice, and discrimination on people’s level have gone online, it was even more devastating for us, and that's why we decided to come together on the Cambodian side to rally among ourselves,” said Lim Solinn, a Cambodian social activist and artist. She later reached out to friends in Thailand in different places and then stumbled upon a group of Thai people who are a network of solidarity. Ou Tepphallin, a Cambodian labor rights activist and campaign co-organizer, said she joined the campaign to address the suffering of migrant workers and communities caught in the crossfire of recent tensions, particularly Cambodian workers in Thailand and Thai workers in Cambodia. They faced physical violence and racism, and they were living with fear, so their voices were unheard. On top of that, children living along the border have lost opportunities to study due to the closure of border crossings. Family members were separated, such as a child whose mother was in Thailand but whose father was in Phnom Penh, and they have no idea when they can be reunited. In addition, according to the Thai authorities, the conflict since July 24th has also caused over 500,000 Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand to return home, since most of them felt unsafe and threatened in Thailand. This has left Thailand with a significant labor shortage as Cambodian migrants typically played an essential role in the country's agricultural industry. Solinn stated that both Thai and Cambodian campaign organizers want the campaign to go viral in both countries and send messages to leaders saying, “Please don't use violence on Cambodian or Thai migrant workers.” The campaigners are also trying to figure out catchy ways for this campaign to go viral and reach regular Thais and Cambodians. The campaign includes writing poems and making songs, which they believe could help calm people and encourage them not to hate simply because of what they heard or saw on the news. “We’re just starting, even if the war ends tomorrow, the hatred continues, so we need to continue this work and reach out to more communities in Cambodia and in Thailand,” said Solinn. Phallin added that it's time to heal those who suffered from both sides, and that is what the campaign did by starting to send healing messages to ordinary people. When hatred is louder than empathy In Thailand, when the armed conflict erupted and innocent Thai civilians and military personnel were killed, many Thai netizens demanded tit for tat retaliation. In addition, right-wing influencers have threatened Cambodian migrant workers and called on patriots to use violence against them. Often, those who oppose this and call for a peaceful approach face condemnation online for being too optimistic or unpatriotic. “All the ordinary Cambodians want nothing but peace and harmony with our neighbours, and a lot of people get caught in between these polarizations, and because of the level of their vulnerability, they cannot get their voices heard at all,” noted Solinn. On the Cambodian side, Solinn remarked that while they wanted peace and for this war to stop, most Cambodians also became enraged and emotional when they saw news about civilians being affected, schools being bombed, or news that many people were displaced. She disclosed that since she and her friends launched the campaign, she has been harassed by netizens from both countries. For her, it has been difficult to get through to people how the hyper-nationalistic, violent narratives are spreading hate. Solinn said: They have been misinformed and disinformed. They believe these sets of stories, and they have these perspectives, and it's hard to change. So, instead of trying to tell them a different version, we’re trying to appeal to their consciousness. We try to appeal to their empathy. Even though most of the information they received was not real, it was effective as it was coupled with prejudice, stereotyping, and hate speech amplified by social media. “It has added fuel to the fire of ultra nationalist perspectives. It just made it really hard for people to try to bridge across for people who are like us,” said Solinn. She insisted that engaging with the same outrage and accusing each other of doing what each side thinks is wrong will not improve the situation, particularly for disputes that have been going on for hundreds of years, based on selective history from both sides. Solinn emphasized that it was time to put people’s lives first. Children should be able to return to school instead of living in refugee camps, families should be able to earn their livelihoods again, and both countries need to recognize the damage the conflict has inflicted on their economies. A call for peace: rebuilding trust and fostering empathy “We would like to urge the leaders to sit down and find a peaceful resolution and put the people first,” said Phallin. She also urged the leaders to negotiate and rebuild trust, insisting that peace can be achieved only by negotiation, not war. In the meantime, Solinn urged the leaders to be compassionate and gentle and to reach a peaceful resolution, adding that a tremendous amount of strength is required. The campaign organizer also called on leaders on both sides to stop this war and allow everything to return to normal for the sake of the innocent people from both countries. She suggested that Thailand and Cambodia stop promoting biases and stereotypes based on selective interpretations of history, particularly for the younger generations. Solinn also believes that when this war ends, Thais and Cambodians will come together to create mixed communities where people from both sides could share safe spaces and raise awareness of peace and harmony. “Educating in school or through the media wouldn't be enough. We need all the spaces, all the communities, we need a whole society to heal and to promote racial tolerance, peace, solidarity, and harmony,” said Phallin. In terms of media, Solinn said media, particularly mainstream media, in both countries should not amplify hateful rhetoric, which has already been dominant on social media, but rather people’s stories, which would help promote reconciliation and peace, suggesting that selective parts of the history on both sides shouldn’t be allowed to frame the whole narrative about Thailand and Cambodia. She noted that we did not know everything, but only heard different sides of the story. Each side believed the other started the war first or believed that the other side encroached upon their land. “Trust is so fragile. It's so easy to break, and it's broken already. It's very hard to rebuild, but we must try. We do not have a choice,” noted Solinn.",

    "text": "Nigeria’s whistleblower policy, introduced on December 21, 2016, was designed as a quick fix to expose systemic corruption. It promised whistleblowers between 2.5 and 5 percent of recovered looted public funds. However, while the policy incentivizes disclosures, it does not guarantee protection. Instead, whistleblowers often face surveillance, dismissal, or even death threats. Multiple attempts to pass a whistleblower protection bill over the years have stalled in Nigeria’s National Assembly, leaving whistleblowers legally vulnerable. Nigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework On September 18, 2025, Federal High Court judges and civil society advocates debated on Nigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework at a national interactive forum convened by the African Centre for Media & Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) for federal high court judges, in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city. Harry Ogwuche, the Director of Economic and Social Rights at Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), shared during the debate: Protecting whistleblowers is not an abstract anti-corruption strategy; it is a direct, proactive investment in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights as enshrined in Chapter IV of our Constitution and various international covenants Nigeria is party to. The role of judges in protecting whistleblowers While seeking the support of judges in the advocacy for a whistleblower protection law in Nigeria, Chido Onumah, Coordinator of AFRICMIL, said: Judges are key actors in any judicial system. Therefore, the forum aims to provide a platform for interaction with judges on whistleblowing, its legal framework, and the critical role they play in ensuring justice for whistleblowers and handling corruption cases effectively. At the forum, persecuted whistleblower Yisa Usman shared how he was pressured, intimidated, and sidelined from his profession after blowing the whistle on his company. Usman is a chartered accountant who worked in the finance and accounts department, but after exposing corruption, he was redeployed to the ICT department, transferred to different states, and subsequently fired. He said: Because I decided to speak up, I am jobless. I was ostracized and frustrated to accept the norm. To remain silent is to be complicit. To achieve results as a whistleblower, it is important to be familiar with the laws because if you know the laws that guide and protect you, you will be able to challenge them. Despite several attempts to detain me, I am walking free because of the judiciary. Existing and pending laws to protect whistleblowers Nigeria’s Constitution and several statutes already contain protections that could be extended to whistleblowers. These include: Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. Section 6(4)(c) of the National Human Rights Commission Act prohibits harassment of individuals who cooperate with the Commission. Anti-corruption laws like the EFCC Act and ICPC Act provide limited safeguards. The Freedom of Information Act protects disclosures made in good faith. In practice, these fragmented provisions are inconsistently applied, and without a unified protection law, whistleblowers continue to face retaliation. Nigeria’s situation contrasts sharply with that of its regional neighbors. Ghana’s Whistleblower Act (Act 720) and South Africa’s Protected Disclosures Act provide dedicated mechanisms. Vladimir Radomirović, a Serbian journalist and co-founder of Pištaljka, an organization based in Belgrade that provides free legal aid and protection to whistleblowers, shared his experiences of building alliances with the judiciary to strengthen whistleblower protection in Serbia. He said: The judges have a very influential role in protecting whistleblowers in Serbia, and we try to work with judges and allow them to hear from whistleblowers about how they are retaliated against for protecting the public interest. AFRICMIL and its partners urged the Nigerian legislature to urgently enact the whistleblower protection law, one that guarantees anonymity, provides penalties against retaliation, and establishes an independent body to oversee cases. Whistleblowers and civil society organizations appealed to judges to embrace a proactive role in safeguarding whistleblowers. They called for progressive adjudication that interprets existing laws in the spirit of transparency and protection for defenders; expedited hearings to ensure justice is not delayed and therefore denied; the awarding of exemplary damages against retaliators to serve as a deterrent; and above all, the protection of anonymity in court procedures. These recommendations, they argued, are vital if the judiciary is to strengthen trust, uphold justice, and ensure that whistleblowing truly serves as a tool for accountability in Nigeria.",

    "text": "There are nearly 4,900 registered print media outlets in Nepal. Around eighteen news outlets operate exclusively online through digital platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. By law, online media must register with Nepal’s Department of Information and Broadcasting; however, not all outlets currently comply with this requirement. Standing out among these registered outlets is Khoj Samachar, an independent digital media platform that raises awareness among young people, challenges corruption, and amplifies underrepresented voices in Nepal. Its founder, Roshan Shrestha, is an investigative journalist from Nepal. His approach relies on digital platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and a dedicated app to draw public attention to marginalized stories and pressure authorities to take action. The platform publishes content in Nepali, in both text and video formats. Abdulrosheed Fadipe of Global Voices interviewed Roshan via WhatsApp to discuss his journey as an investigative journalist and how he uses digital platforms to promote social change, strengthen good governance, and encourage citizen engagement in Nepal. Global Voices (GV): What inspired you to start Khoj Samachar, and what challenges did you face in building it from scratch? Roshan Shrestha (RS): I started my journalism journey during my school years at Shree Bachchhala Devi Higher Secondary School, Nagpuje, Sindhupalchok District, in Bagmati Province of Nepal. When I was in class 8, a man who was the presenter at Avenues Television came to my school to teach students about journalism. That training programme planted the seed of journalism in my mind. My interest in journalism grew after a devastating earthquake occurred in Nepal in 2015. Although the epicenter of the earthquake was located in Gorkha district, many houses in my village, which is located near the Bhotekoshi River, were destroyed. Many people lost their lives. The Tataponi border crossing with China was also closed. I had just completed class 11 then. I was using a simple Android phone because I was from a low-middle-class family that depended on agriculture for a living. With that phone, I started filming and uploading videos of the earthquake's destruction of villages on a YouTube channel. This was how my journalism career began. In 2021, I officially launched Khoj Samachar. I did not receive any financial support when I started nor did I have a big team. Now we have a team of four individuals broadcasting news in both English and Nepali. GV: How do you maintain editorial independence and ensure your outlet's content remains unbiased and free from external influences? Roshan Shrestha (RS): We do not take money, favors, or support from any political party, business group, or outside donor. From day one, Khoj Samachar has survived only through the income we earn from Facebook and YouTube ads. With those limited earnings, we pay our team and run the entire platform. This is not always easy, but it gives us full freedom. Nobody can tell us what to say or what to hide. We can question leaders, expose corruption, and speak for the people without fear of losing sponsors or upsetting funders. Our only loyalty is to our readers and viewers. For us, independence is more valuable than comfort. Even if the road is difficult, we choose truth over compromise — that is why our content remains unbiased and trusted. GV: How do you prioritize stories that amplify underrepresented media voices, and what impact do you hope these stories have on your audience? Roshan Shrestha (RS): At Khoj Samachar, we always give priority to the voices that big media often ignores — farmers, workers, rural youth, and ordinary citizens who face injustice. Many times, people from villages directly contact us to share their pain, because they feel unheard elsewhere. We have highlighted stories like that of a person struggling to get a bridge built in his village, a road left unfinished for 10 years, or a family trapped in hardship without support. By showing these issues through videos, we try to bring public attention and pressure the authorities to act. Our hope is that by giving a platform to these underrepresented voices, young people will feel more connected, more aware, and inspired to raise their own voices. We want our audience to see that journalism is not only about leaders and cities, but also about the real struggles of common people — and that truth can bring real change. GV: What strategies do you use to reach audiences beyond capital cities, and how do you measure the impact of your reporting in these areas? Roshan Shrestha (RS): From the beginning, our focus was not only on Kathmandu but also on rural and remote areas. We create stories that reflect the real problems of villages — like missing bridges in Humla, neglected roads in Dailekh, or migrant workers’ struggles. Many of these issues are sent to us directly by local people through phone calls, Facebook messages, or our app. By turning their voices into reports and videos, we make sure their problems are heard nationally. To measure impact, we look at the response from citizens and authorities. For example, in Saudi Arabia, when stranded workers contacted us, our coverage led to parliamentary debates and direct government action. Similarly, when we cover local problems, we monitor community feedback in comments, shares, and messages, and also check if the government or local representatives respond. For us, the real impact is when ordinary people feel their voices are finally heard and some positive change begins. GV: What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced as an independent journalist, and how have you overcome them? RS: There have been many difficult moments in my journey, but the most painful ones came when some people, who are unable to accept the truth, started abusing my family and even threatened physical attacks in public. As a journalist, I can tolerate criticism and risk, but when my family is dragged into controversy for my work, it is truly unbearable. Speaking the truth, especially against corruption and powerful figures, always brings political pressure. Many tried to silence us or scare us into stopping, but journalism loses its meaning if we compromise with fear. What keeps me going is the trust and support of the public and the inner courage to always speak the truth. The emotional burden is heavy, but I continue because ordinary people rely on us to be their voice, and that responsibility gives me the strength to move forward. GV: How do you envision the future of Khoj Samachar, and what steps are you taking to ensure its sustainability and continued impact? RS: My main goal is to build Khoj Samachar as a platform based only on truth and facts, not dependent on external funding or political power. The message I want to pass to youth is that they can succeed in journalism by standing for the truth, even if they are alone. I am working to add more features to the Roshan Shrestha App so that it will be useful for the public. This step will help us sustain our work, expand our impact, and keep serving society with independent journalism. GV: Why did you name the Roshan Shrestha App after yourself? RS: By putting my own name on the app, I wanted to assure users that this platform is genuine, transparent, and trustworthy. It is not for self-promotion but rather a matter of responsibility: if my name is attached, people know they can rely on it.",

In these disruptive and uncertain times, the proliferation and fragmentation of the aid system continues to jeopardise the effectiveness, quality and impact of development co-operation. Increased development effectiveness, including better coordination among diverse partners, reduced transaction costs and burdens on partner countries, and strengthened country systems, is needed to maximise the impact of limited resources and better respond to the needs of people and the planet. It is in this context that the UNDP carried out its work on the Global Project on Managing Development Co-operation Effectively in 2024, delivering on three strategic components in line with the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation’s (the ‘Global Partnership’) 2023-2026 Work Programme. The UNDP team that undertook this work is part of the Global Partnership’s OECD-UNDP Joint Support Team (UNDP JST hereafter). This 2024 Annual Status Report provides an overview of the key results achieved by the UNDP JST for the UNDP Global Project over the past year in the areas of monitoring, policy action, and advocacy. It was an important year for the Global Partnership’s partner country-led monitoring exercise. After the official launch of the 4th Global Partnership monitoring round in January 2023, the UNDP JST supported 34 partner countries in 2024 to undertake the monitoring exercise. This included providing technical assistance, informative sessions, and substantive products to support National Coordinators in their implementation of “inception” phase of the exercise, as well as supporting countries entering the final “reflection, dialogue, and action” phase. Eleven countries finished data collection in 2024, of which one country completed the final dialogue and action phase with UNDP support. In addition, a monitoring training for African countries participating in the current round of the exercise was held in June in Ethiopia. The UNDP JST provided substantive and organisational support to the training, as well as co-delivering the training with OECD colleagues. The UNDP JST also achieved results in policy action in 2024, providing substantive support to the Global Partnership’s Co-Chairs and Steering Committee members for two Steering Committee meetings held in June and November. Preparations for the 4th International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4) in Spain in July 2025, kickstarted in 2024. UNDP JST supported Co-Chairs and Steering Committee members in raising the profile of development effectiveness on the road to FfD4, including by drafting political messaging and supporting the organization of an Informal Meeting on Development Effectiveness and FfD4 on the margins of the Second Preparatory Committee in December 2024 in New York. UNDP JST also supported the first “Action Dialogue” of the 2023-2026 Monitoring Round which was successfully held in Nepal in November 2024, generating action-oriented commitments at the policy level, including 5 the adoption of a new Development Finance Information Management System, the review of Nepal’s 2019 Development Co-operation Policy, and the consolidation of Nepal’s Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF). On advocacy and communications, the UNDP JST conducted a range of activities and outputs aligned with the priorities laid out in the 2023-2026 Advocacy & Outreach Plan. Highlights from 2024 include the hosting of a side event on the margins of the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF) in July and supporting a side event at Indonesia’s High-Level Forum on Multi-Stakeholder Partnership in September. UNDP JST also developed new targeted advocacy products, published blogs and stories of progress, and disseminated key messages through the Global Partnership’s newsletter and social media. Finally, preparations were made for the launch of a new website and data visualization platform in 2025. As reflected in this report, throughout 2024, significant progress was made to advance the Global Project on Managing Development Co-operation Effectively. Looking ahead to 2025, UNDP JST will continue to advance the Global Project through ongoing support to the implementation of the Global Partnership’s 2023-2026 Work Programme. This includes, inter alia, through policy and advocacy work related to FfD4, communications work led by UNDP JST, and close support from UNDP JST to partner countries to carry out the Global Partnership’s monitoring exercise, This report is prepared by the Effective Development Co-operation team. The team constitutes the UNDP JST and is part of UNDP’s Bureau for External Relations and Advocacy (BERA). 6 ABOUT THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP AND THE UNDP GLOBAL PROJECT About the Global Partnership The Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation (‘Global Partnership’) is the primary multi-stakeholder vehicle for driving the effectiveness of all types of development co-operation to deliver sustainable development. By convening partners around the four effectiveness principles – country ownership, focus on results, inclusive partnerships, and transparency and mutual accountability – the Global Partnership is helping countries catalyze their SDG progress by: • Bringing partners together in a principle-led approach, fostering trust, and by • Generating data for an evidence-based approach, empowering policy action. Figure 1: Graphic explaining the four principles of effective development co-operation Source: 'GPEDC At a Glance' At the heart of the work of the Global Partnership is its monitoring exercise. The monitoring is a partner country-led exercise to promote collective accountability on the effectiveness of development co-operation. Guided by the four principles, the monitoring tracks progress of partner countries, development partners and other actors in implementing their agreed commitments to more effective development co-operation. The monitoring exercise drives behaviour change by focusing on how stakeholders partner at the country level for better development results. In 2024, the work of the Global Partnership continued to be guided by the Work Programme for 2023-2026. The overall vision of the Work Programme is to strengthen the effectiveness of development co-operation to spur progress towards the Sustainable 7 Development Goals (SDGs). The UNDP JST delivers on its core functions through the Global Project on Managing Development Co-operation Effectively (‘Global Project’) in line with the three core outputs of the Work Programme, which are to: 1. Generate Evidence: through the New Monitoring Exercise The Global Partnership monitoring framework is refined, strengthened, and implemented to support global accountability and mutual learning on effective development co-operation. 2. Drive Informed Policy Dialogue & Action: through Country Dialogues, Strategic Partnerships and the Achievement of the SDGs An increased number of countries strengthen, or are taking action to strengthen, policy and institutional arrangements that support integrated approaches to planning; more efficient management of diverse development co-operation flows; and enhanced coordination and stronger multi-stakeholder partnerships. 3. Foster Political Awareness, Behaviour Change and Uptake: Targeted Advocacy and Outreach A strengthened mutual learning and knowledge exchange platform, facilitating the sharing of country-level evidence, and learning from different modalities of development co-operation. About the UNDP Global Project As part of the OECD-UNDP Joint Support Team (JST), UNDP JST works to strengthen effective development co-operation by supporting the work of the Global Partnership. Within the JST, UNDP brings to the Global Partnership its substantive and operational footprint, network, and infrastructure at global, regional, and country levels as well as collaboration across the UN development system. Functions supported by UNDP as part of the JST center around policy work related to effective development co-operation, support to country-level implementation, particularly to anchor the Global Partnership monitoring in country-led efforts to spur implementation of the 2030 Agenda, as well as knowledge sharing, communications and advocacy on development effectiveness. Moreover, UNDP cultivates a robust effectiveness community through management of strategic communication and knowledge sharing solutions in coordination with the UN development system. Specifically, the following tasks are carried out by UNDP JST: • Co-Chairs: UNDP, together with OECD, provides strategic advisory support and guidance for Co-Chairs to take decisions and forge consensus. • Steering Committee and Work Programme: UNDP, together with OECD, provides strategic advisory support to facilitate Steering Committee decision making. 8 • Senior- and High-level Meetings and inputs to other meetings (Financing for Development Forum, HLPF, etc.): UNDP and OECD provide substantive support based on membership and type of event. • Monitoring: o Pre-inception and inception phases: UNDP leads on partner country outreach and is the main responsible actor for this phase. o Data collection and review: UNDP contributes on specific pre-agreed tasks. o Country-level dialogue, action planning and follow up phases: UNDP leads and is the main responsible actor to support partner countries with country level action during this phase of the monitoring exercise. o Results analysis and reporting: Joint responsibility of OECD and UNDP. • Advocacy and Strategic Communication, Learning and Knowledge Management: UNDP leads advancement of the effectiveness agenda through strategic communications, advocacy and knowledge management by positioning the Global Partnership and country-level engagement within broader global development co-operation discourse/action. 9 KEY RESULTS ACHIEVED IN 2024 Output 1: Monitoring The Global Partnership monitoring exercise is the main source of evidence that tracks stakeholders’ commitments on effectiveness, empowering partners and building trust in an era of global challenges. The data from the exercise helps countries and their partners to assess the progress they have made, while also being the official source of country and global level data on three SDG indicators: 5.c.1, 17.15.1 and 17.16.1. Since 2011, more than 100 partner countries have led the monitoring exercise in collaboration with hundreds of development partners and other actors. The first three global monitoring rounds took place in 2014, 2016, and 2018. From 2020-2022, a participatory and comprehensive reform of the monitoring exercise – both what is collected (the framework) and how (the process) – ensured the exercise continues to meet its original aims and the evolving needs of stakeholders. Roll-Out of the 2023-2026 Monitoring Round The 4th Global Partnership Monitoring Exercise was launched in January 2023, and as of December 2024, 59 partner countries committed to participate. In 2024, five additional countries signed up for the exercise (Central African Republic, Kenya, Madagascar, Moldova and Somalia) and 34 of the participating 59 countries kicked off the monitoring exercise in their country. Eleven countries completed data collection by the end 2024. All of the above updates, including the results for those countries where it was available in 2024, were reflected by UNDP JST on the Global Partnership’s website so interested parties could follow the progress of participating countries in real time. At the country level, the monitoring exercise entails the following five phases: Figure 2: The five phases of the Global Partnership monitoring exercise Source: GPEDC Website 10 Among other things, the UNDP JST leads support to partner countries on the pre- inception and inception phase of the monitoring exercise (phase 1). As such, in 2024, UNDP supported: • More than 65 pre-inception and inception briefings with 34 partner countries; • Ongoing coordination with 28 United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) to support the exercise; • 11 multi-stakeholder kick-off consultations that launched the monitoring process; • Tailored briefings on data reporting and review with 15 partner countries; • Drafting of 7 roadmaps • Strengthened coordination with the UN Development Coordination Office (DCO) that led to increased UNCT support to the GPEDC monitoring exercise along with assistance from Resident Coordinator Offices (RCOs) to national co-ordinators, including in the identification of focal points to report monitoring data. The UNDP JST also leads on supporting partner countries with the reflection, dialogue and action phase of the monitoring (phase 5). With 11 countries completing the data submission and results dissemination phases (3 and 4) in 2024, UNDP JST prepared substantive materials and provided support to partner countries in preparation for phase 5. This included the following: • Guidance note: an informative resource designed to support National Co- ordinators and stakeholders with detailed guidance and examples on how to prepare for, and conduct the reflection, dialogue and action phase. • Communications flyer: a summarised version of the guidance note, providing National Co-ordinators and stakeholders with a short snapshot of the main characteristics of action dialogues and the expectations of Phase 5. • Sense checking calls with UNDP Country Offices (COs): informal preparatory meetings organized with UNDP COs and UN RCOs after each country concludes the data collection phase, with the objectives of exchanging impressions of the monitoring findings, exploring potential synergies for anchoring Phase 5 to existing coordination mechanisms at country level, and strengthening UNDP CO capacity to provide additional logistical and technical support to National Coordinators in preparing multi-stakeholder action dialogues. • Tailored briefing sessions: informative sessions delivered to National Coordinators after their monitoring results were provided. During these sessions, National Coordinators were provided with a brief recap of their progress and current country status in the monitoring exercise; a detailed description of the reflection, dialogue and action phase, including the specific activities and expected outputs to be generated as part of the implementation of Phase 5; and an open-floor segment to address questions and discuss coordination with, and potential support from, UNDP COs and UN RCOs. 11 3rd Monitoring Training for Partner Countries Building on two trainings held in 2023 in Indonesia and Korea, the Government of Canada funded and organized a third training opportunity for African countries participating in the current round of the monitoring exercise. The training was hosted by Ethiopia under the leadership and guidance of the Global Partnership Co-Chairs. UNDP JST was a close partner in the delivery of the training, providing substantive and organisational support. The training took place from 3-5 June 2024 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and was delivered by the OECD-UNDP JST of the Global Partnership to a group of 36 participants comprising of the Global Partnership Co-Chairs, representatives from Canada and UNDP, and representatives from 19 partner country governments, including Benin, Cabo Verde, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Togo, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Over three days, participants engaged in workshop discussions to foster peer-to-peer learning and develop a thorough understanding of the process and framework of the Global Partnership monitoring exercise and reflect on ways in which the exercise could make development co-operation in their countries more effective. The training covered five modules: • Module 1: Introduction to the Global Partnership and the broader development effectiveness agenda • Module 2: Introduction to the Global Partnership’s monitoring exercise and overview of the process • Module 3: Fundamentals of the monitoring framework • Module 4: Stakeholder engagement and institutionalisation • Module 5: Use of results and peer learning opportunities An additional extra-official session was held on the South-South Co-operation Self- Assessment, where the main conclusions of the work piloted by Colombia in 2022 were presented, and participants’ interest in a potential new round of pilot work was assessed. Results from a short exit survey completed by participants indicated that the training programme objectives were achieved. Participants in the training indicated having strengthened their understanding of the Global Partnership monitoring framework and process and appreciated the opportunity to enhance their strategies for approaching and engaging with different development stakeholders to complete the monitoring exercise. The exchange of country experiences from previous monitoring rounds was also appreciated by participants. 12 Image 1: Participants at the 2024 Training on the Global Partnership Monitoring Source: UNDP JST Image 2: Training participants engaging in small-group discussions Source: UNDP JST Output 2: Policy Action Support to Steering Committee Meetings UNDP, together with OECD, provided substantive and operational support to the Global Partnership Co-Chairs and the Steering Committee members in organising two virtual Steering Committee meetings in 2024. Within the JST, UNDP leads on engagement with partner country Steering Committee members, as well as the following 13 members: Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS), African Union Development Agency - New Partnership for Africa’s Development (AUDA-NEPAD), and the Group of Seven Plus (g7+). The 27th Steering Committee Meeting was held virtually from 12-13 June 2024. In attendance were 25 representatives from partner countries, as well as representatives from PIFS, NEPAD and g7+. In addition to supporting these partner countries and representatives, UNDP JST helped secure the attendance of Burkina Faso as an observer to the meeting, and foster partner country participation. Members assessed progress against the 2023-2026 Work Programme, discussed the rollout of the 4th Monitoring Round, developed a joint vision for development effectiveness ahead of preparatory meetings for the 4th International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4) and explored resourcing needs for the ongoing work of the Partnership. With support from the UNDP JST, Burkina Faso, Nepal and the Philippines shared their experiences as three of the countries undertaking the monitoring exercise, sharing different strategies for overcoming effectiveness challenges at country level through the monitoring process. Japan was welcomed as a new member of the Steering Committee, taking over from the Republic of Korea as one of the representatives of development partners. This was also the final meeting for Mr. Vitalice Meja from Reality of Aid Africa, who since 2018 held the seat for the “Non-Executive Co-Chair” representing non-governmental voices on the Steering Committee. From the second half of 2024, Ms. Nurgul Dzhanaeva (President of the Forum of Women’s NGOs of Kyrgyzstan) and Mr. Luca De Fraia (Deputy Secretary General of Action Aid Italy) took up shared responsibility for the Non-Executive Co-Chair seat as an ad interim arrangement. The 28th Steering Committee Meeting was held virtually from 26-27 November 2024. In attendance were 20 representatives from partner countries, as well as representatives from PIFS, NEPAD and g7+. In addition to supporting these partner countries and representatives, UNDP JST helped secure the attendance of Uganda as an observer to the meeting, fostering increased partner country participation. Meeting at the mid-point of the 2023-2026 Work Programme, and following inclusive consultations, members finalized and approved the 2025/26 Action Plan. In addition, members assessed progress on the ongoing monitoring round and strategized on how best to revitalise and garner political support for development effectiveness in the run up to FfD4. Australia was welcomed as a new member of the Steering Committee, taking over from Canada as a representative of development partners. UNDP JST also supported the participation of the representative of the UN development system in the Steering Committee, a seat currently held by the UN Development Coordination Office (DCO). UNDP JST provided briefing notes and substantive material for DCO participation in Steering Committee Meetings as well as ongoing engagement with the Global Partnership. UNDP JST works closely with DCO to provide support to UN Resident Coordinators, UNDP Resident Representatives and UN Country Teams in countries undertaking the monitoring exercise. 14 Nepal becomes the First Country to Move into the Learning, Dialogue and Action Phase of the Monitoring Exercise The final reflection, dialogue and action phase (“phase 5”) of the Global Partnership monitoring exercise is a unique opportunity for all actors to reflect on the results, discuss underlying explanations of the monitoring findings, and collectively identify and agree on ways to make development co-operation more effective. It is a crucial feature of the Global Partnership monitoring exercise that aims at generating behaviour change for stronger development impact through inclusive follow-up and country-level dialogue, learning, and joint action. In 2024, Nepal became the first country to complete this final phase of the monitoring when it held its multi-stakeholder Action Dialogue on 21 November 2024. It was an opportunity to reflect on the monitoring results and agree on joint actions to enhance the effectiveness of development co-operation at country level. The dialogue was based on the country’s findings - published here in July 2024 - from the Global Partnership monitoring exercise. The results draw on consultations and data on effective development co-operation reported by over 30 development partners and other stakeholders. Receiving these results initiated the monitoring exercise’s final phase, which focuses on reflection, dialogue and action. UNDP JST closely supported Nepal’s action dialogue. This included holding calls with the National Coordinator, UNDP CO and UN RCO, as well as producing logistical, technical and substantive materials, including: a “results dissemination communication” to support the National Coordinator in disseminating the results among Nepal’s development partners and stakeholders while announcing their action dialogue; a draft action dialogue concept note and proposed agenda based on consultations with the National Coordinator’s team; an action dialogue ‘save the date’; personalized invitations template; a set of draft emails and reminders in preparation to the action dialogue; a list of participants; a visual aid for the National Coordinator to present the monitoring results during the dialogue; a form to collect inputs from development partners and stakeholders designed to support the National Coordinator in drafting the action- oriented outcome document; and a draft story of progress highlighting key action- oriented commitments. Following several months of careful planning, the dialogue on the monitoring results led to action-oriented commitments across seven key areas, including the adoption of a new Development Finance Information Management system, a review of Nepal’s 2019 International Development Co-operation Policy and the consolidation of Nepal’s INFF. 15 Image 3: Participants in Nepal’s Action Dialogue Source: International Economic Co-operation Coordination Division, Ministry of Finance, Nepal Image 4: A presentation is made during Nepal’s Action Dialogue Source: International Economic Co-operation Coordination Division, Ministry of Finance, Nepal Preparations for the 4th International Conference on Financing for Development At the 27th Steering Committee Meeting in June 2024, members agreed that the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4), to be held in Spain in July 2025, presents a rare political opportunity to boost global awareness and action on 16 development effectiveness. Throughout 2024, UNDP JST was therefore involved in supporting Co-Chairs and Steering Committee members in raising the profile of development effectiveness on the road to FfD4. In July 2024, the FfD4 Co-Facilitators called for inputs to an Elements Paper which would put forward potential elements of the FFD4 Outcome Document. In response, UNDP JST supported the preparation of a joint Global Partnership input and coordinated the integration of feedback by partner country Steering Committee Members. Based on the Global Partnership’s input to the Elements Paper, UNDP JST also developed key effectiveness messages for FfD4. Furthermore, UNDP JST provided detailed coverage of the FfD4 Preparatory Process for Co-Chairs and Steering Committee members. The team also developed a series of news articles that focused on FfD4 and highlighted development effectiveness-related references by UN Member States and other groups. This included: o FfD Forum (22-25 April): “Partners Demand Greater Focus on Development Effectiveness at this Year’s UN FfD Forum” o First Preparatory Committee (22-26 July): “Revitalizing the Development Effectiveness Agenda: Insights from the FfD4 Preparatory Committee” o Intersessional Multi-Stakeholder Hearing (28 October): “Universalizing the Development Effectiveness Principles: Insights from the FfD4 Multi- Stakeholder Hearing” o Second Preparatory Committee (3-6 December): “Putting Countries ‘In the Driver’s Seat’: Insights from the Second FfD4 Preparatory Committee” Finally, at the Second FfD4 Preparatory Committee Meeting in December 2024, UNDP JST supported the Co-Chairs of the Global Partnership to host an Informal Meeting on Development Effectiveness and FfD4. The informal meeting convened over 25 representatives interested in development effectiveness and discussed how to raise the profile of the effectiveness agenda on the road to FfD4. In attendance were delegates from Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, European Commission, Japan, Mexico, Russian Federation, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Zambia and representatives from Eurodad, g7+ Secretariat, IBON International, Millenium Challenge Corporation, OECD, Reality of Aid Africa, TOSSD, UN DESA, WINGS, and World Bank Group. Participants exchanged views on how effectiveness was reflected in the Elements Paper and highlighted what they would like to prioritize on effectiveness in the forthcoming FfD4 outcome document. UNDP JST drafted a summary of the key discussions, which was circulated to participants on behalf of Global Partnership Co- Chairs. UNDP JST also supported the establishment of a group of effectiveness ‘champions’ in New York to continue effectiveness conversations ahead of FfD4. 17 Image 5: Participants at the Informal Meeting on Development Effectiveness and FfD4 (December 2024) Source: UNDP JST Output 3: Advocacy and Communications Within the JST, UNDP leads the Global Partnership’s advocacy and outreach activities, including implementing the 2023-2026 Advocacy & Outreach Plan. The objective of the Global Partnership’s advocacy and outreach is to foster political awareness to provoke behaviour change and uptake of effective development co-operation and systematic learning, in turn promoting action towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Engagement in Strategic Events High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) In 2024, UNDP JST organized a high-level side event on the margins of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development in July. A year before FfD4, the event officially marked the launch of advocacy efforts ahead of FfD4. The side event, entitled “Road to FfD4: Laying the groundwork for a new era of transparency and development effectiveness,” was jointly hosted by the Global Partnership, the International Aid Transparency Initiative, and the Government of Nigeria. UNDP JST led on substantive development of the concept note and run of show, coordinated speakers and organised logistics including interpretation and catering. During and after the side event, UNDP JST drafted and disseminated media advisories, executed communication campaigns and press releases. Attended by over 60 in-person stakeholders from partner countries, development partners, and civil society organizations (CSOs), the 18 event addressed the impact of the development effectiveness agenda in the decade since the Third International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD3) and set out why the effectiveness principles should be recognised in the final FfD4 outcome document. The event included interventions from two of the partner countries (Chad and Nigeria) that are currently undertaking the monitoring exercise. The news article from the side event, developed by UNDP JST, can be found here.

A side 19 event entitled “How the GPEDC Global Monitoring Exercise is Making Development Co-operation More Effective and Country-Owned” was hosted by the Co-Chairs of the Global Partnership (Indonesia, Sweden, Democratic Republic of Congo, and the CSO Partnership for Development Effectiveness), with substantive support to the concept note and communications around the event by the UNDP JST. The side event highlighted that while mobilizing resources remains essential to advance development objectives, ensuring the quality of finance and partnerships is equally critical.

In a session entitled “Partnerships for Development: Empowering National Stakeholders in ODA,” UNDP JST presented the importance of the effectiveness principles in development co-operation, their connection to multi-stakeholder engagement and highlighted the Global Partnership’s offerings to emerging donors in the region. Communications and Advocacy Products Developed and Disseminated in 2024 In October 2024, upon the advice of UNDP JST, Co-Chairs agreed that a new website for the Global Partnership should be developed. The new website would move away from the underutilized community-based platform, to one that is accessible, easily understood, and showcases the Global Partnership’s impact and monitoring results at country level. Therefore in 2024, UNDP JST led on the development of Terms of Reference for the procurement of a developer for the new website, to be launched in mid-2025. 20 The following advocacy products were developed by UNDP JST in 2024, in line with the 2023-2026 Advocacy & Outreach Plan. • Key advocacy messages for the following events: o 68th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (11-22 March) o 2024 UN Financing for Development Forum (22-25 April) o 4th International Conference on Small Island Developing States (27-30 May) o 2024 High-Level Political Forum (17-18 July) o High-Level Forum on Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships (1-3 September) o Summit of the Future and 79th Session of the UN General Assembly (10- 24 September) o 5th UN World Data Forum (12-15 November) o Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (30 June – 3 July 2025) • Flyer highlighting why different partners join the monitoring round • Flyer on Phase 5 of the 2023-2026 Monitoring Round • Effectiveness Dictionary • Short videos highlighting the importance of development effectiveness in the lead up to FfD4: o https://x.com/DevCooperation/status/1848334867295076681 o https://x.com/DevCooperation/status/1854570102059868468 o https://x.com/DevCooperation/status/1864310187034857903 UNDP JST supports the outreach, editing, publication and promotion of opinion pieces and articles from expert practitioners working on effective development co-operation. In addition, UNDP JST drafts stories that highlight the progress countries have made in building key policies, processes and plans for more effective development co-operation at the country level. The following stories and blogs were published on the Global Partnership website in 2024 (cross-posted content is italicized): • GPEDC 2023 Retrospective: Learnings from Global Partnership Events • Aid to Afghanistan: An Insider’s Take on Lessons to be Learnt • GPEDC 2023 Retrospective: Highlights from the KOICA LAP and Indonesia Training • The road to equitable partnerships • Towards Stronger Partnerships for More Effective Development Co-operation: Uganda Launches its 2023-2026 Monitoring Exercise • DevelopmentAid Dialogues | Profit and Purpose: Aligning Business & Social Good in Development Partnerships • Rethinking Development Co-operation: Aid 2.0 • The Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS calls for development effectiveness: 11 SIDS have committed to monitor their progress • Nigeria’s Vision for FfD4: A New Era for Transparency and Development Effectiveness 21 • Indonesia Amplifies Effectiveness in Global Forums: Improving the Quality of Development Co-operation through the GPEDC Monitoring Exercise • Peru Makes Great Strides in Strengthening Effective Development Co-operation • Data for Effective Development: Insights ahead of the UN World Data Forum 2024 • Rebooting Development Effectiveness on the Road to FfD4: An Essential Pathway to Sustainable Development While a wealth of country stories was published, there were fewer than initially planned in 2024 as these stories focus on country-level impact and many of the countries participating in the Global Partnership monitoring were in inception or data collection phases in 2024. UNDP JST drafts and disseminates key messages, information on upcoming events, and monitoring updates through its newsletter. In 2024, the following 11 Global Partnership newsletters were shared with an audience of over 8000 subscribers: • February • March • April • May • June • July • August • September • October • November • December / “Our 2024 Year of Delivery” In addition, 11 videos were developed on the 11 Country Results Briefs completed in 2024 as part of promoting the Global Partnership monitoring round. Due to delays in external feedback before their release, these were finalized and disseminated in 2025, as part of promotional materials in the lead up to the FfD4. 22 CONCLUSIONS AND WAY FORWARD As demonstrated in this report, 2024 was an eventful year for UNDP JST, the Effective Development Cooperation team in BERA, with tangible outputs in support of the development effectiveness agenda. Significant progress was made to advance the Global Project on Managing Development Co-operation Effectively (see the results log frame in Annex III). In brief, this includes: the roll-out of the 4th monitoring round in over 50 partner countries and completion of the first Action Dialogue; the delivery of a monitoring training workshop; policy advocacy on the road to FfD4; two high-level side events; support to two Steering Committee Meetings; and the development and distribution of a variety of targeted advocacy and communications materials. In terms of resourcing the team to achieve the abovementioned results, the work undertaken in 2024 has been made possible through generous contributions from Canada, the European Commission, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Sweden and Switzerland (see Annex II). The table set out in Annex I provides the financial report of available resources and expenditures under the Global Project for Managing Development Co-operation Effectively in 2024. Looking ahead to 2025, FfD4 in July will be a critical point for the Global Partnership’s policy and advocacy work. The outcomes of the conference will have implications for the direction of the Global Partnership’s work going forward, and the 8th Busan Global Partnership Forum, planned for September 2025, will be the first opportunity after FfD4 for stocktaking on the development effectiveness agenda. UNDP JST will need to proactively engage in the FfD4 process and seek to raise the profile of development effectiveness in the negotiated outcome document. The upcoming year is also critical to the success of the 4th Global Partnership monitoring round, with January 2025 set as the deadline for countries to enter the data collection phase of the exercise. Many countries will finalize data collection in 2025 and enter the dialogue and action phase, a critical moment for country-level reflection and policy change in development co- operation. Throughout 2025, UNDP JST will work closely with partner countries and UN Country Teams to support the monitoring, particularly those countries in the final phase of reflection, dialogue and action. In addition to the policy and advocacy work related to FfD4, and more broadly the communications work led by UNDP JST, alongside UNDP JST’s support to partner countries to carry out the Global Partnership’s monitoring exercise, the team in 2025 will need to provide strategic guidance to Global Partnership Co-Chairs and members on forward planning for the Partnership beyond the end of the 2026 Work Programme. This will require bringing together the: direction set by the FfD4 outcome document; forward- looking vision of Co-Chairs and members; and, opportunities and risks for the Global Partnership in light of the broader geopolitical and development landscape as well as the last remaining years before the close of the implementation period of the 2030 Agenda. UNDP JST, together with UN DCO and UN DESA, will continue to work closely together to ensure that development effectiveness – commitments made and progress toward (as well as lack thereof) – continue to enable partner countries to drive more 23 effective development cooperation in their countries that can in turn lead to long-lasting results and impact. With many thanks to the team’s current donors, funding has been secured for the team to continue its work through 2025. Separately, but also linked to the future plans for the Global Partnership, consideration in 2025 will need to be given to the team’s future beyond the end of the 2025, to seek funding if needed for 2026 and plan for next steps for the Global Partnership as well as the UNDP JST beyond the conclusion of the 2023- 2026 Work Programme. 24 ANNEX I: FINANCIAL PROJECT EXECUTION IN 2024 I.

This framework remains the cornerstone for countries in shaping and guiding national sustainable development strategies. The Voluntary National Reviews (VNRs) are a key part of this process, offering countries a mechanism to assess their progress towards the goals and targets on an annual basis. The 2024 Voluntary National Reviews Through the Lens of Peace, Just and Strong Institutions examine the extent to which member states have integrated SDG 16 in their national priorities and reporting. Have its targets been integrated into national development plans? Are they being monitored and with what data and statistics? How inclusive is the process behind these plans? This report aims to provide member states and stakeholders with the insights needed to enhance their efforts in promoting peace, justice, and strong institutions. It tracks how individual targets are being integrated, highlights where tangible progress is being made, and identifies the policies and initiatives that are shaping that progress. Additionally, it highlights the interlinkages between SDG 16 and other goals, underscoring the importance of more effective integration of SDG 16 in national plans and strategies for achieving progress. Since 2016, when 22 countries presented VNRs in the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF), there has been a steady increase in the number of reports, as well as an increase in the coverage of SDG 16 on peace, just and strong institutions. Review Criteria This report reviews the 36 VNRs presented Western Europe and other States in 2024. This year, four countries reported for 5.6% the fourth time, 13 for the third time and 17 for the second time. Of the 36 VNRs presented, Asia-Pacific 14 were from countries in Africa, 9 from Asia Africa 25% 38.9% and the Pacific, 8 from Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), 3 from Eastern Europe and 2 from Western Europe and other States. This analysis considers (i) whether the countries reported on the SDG 16 targets (ii) the extent of the reporting on these targets; LAC Eastern Europe (iii) interlinkages between SDG 16 and other 22.2% 8.3% SDGs and (iv) whether monitoring and evaluation were part of strategies embedded Regional Breakdown of VNRs – Total = 36 (100%) in the VNRs. For each chapter, this report provides a quantitative and qualitative analysis and illustrates country examples. 5 SDG 16 Priorities Between 2016 and 2024, a substantial increase in reporting was made across all SDG 16 targets. The most significant areas were: Violence reduction (Target 16.1) Child protection (Target 16.2) and Anti-corruption efforts (Target 16.5) Strengthening effective institutions (Target 16.6) While all targets showed an increase in coverage, Target 16.a (Human Rights Institutions) saw the smallest gain. Additionally, legal identity (16.9) and fundamental freedoms (16.10), though improved, may benefit from further support to sustain momentum. Corruption was the most frequently cited issue, with countries introducing new anti-corruption laws, and others requiring asset declarations from officials. Violence was also widely reported, 2016 though it varied in type and severity - discussing issues related to intimate partner violence, child abuse and armed conflict. The range of issues had expanded. Countries reported on violence, governance, rule of law, protection of human rights, anti-corruption, and illicit financial flows. There was also emphasis 2017 on public service delivery, access to information, and accountability, with some reviews highlighting the enabling role of SDG 16 for broader development goals. Many countries underscored the enabling function of SDG 16. Several linked peacebuilding and conflict resolution to progress on SDG 16, particularly through gender-sensitive approaches in peace and security policy. Corruption remained a central challenge, along with 2018 weak institutions, limited legal frameworks, slow justice systems, and gaps in legal identity registration. Nearly all countries had integrated SDG 16 into their VNRs. Member States emphasized reducing violence, protecting human rights, improving transparency and institutional effectiveness, and upholding the rule of law. Special attention was given to protecting 2019 vulnerable populations, children, youth, women, persons with disabilities, and LGBTI individuals. Additionally, many countries reported progress in women’s political participation and birth registration as well as legal identity. 6 Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, 47 countries completed their VNRs and presented them at the High-Level Political Forum. The pandemic had a significant social and economic impact, deepening inequalities and vulnerabilities. Regarding SDG 16, countries focused on reducing violence, child abuse, and corruption, while promoting the rule 2020 of law, legal identity, and transparent institutions. Challenges included a shortage of legal professionals, public distrust in the justice system, and case backlogs. Some countries introduced national strategies to combat organized crime, terrorism, and financial crimes. Access to justice emerged in the VNRs as a main priority, with efforts to expand legal aid, reform courts, and ensure judicial independence. Transparency and anti-corruption measures were widely reported, including oversight reforms, national strategies, and whistleblower protections. Many countries emphasized participatory governance, with initiatives to include 2021 marginalized groups in decision-making. Conflict-affected states focused on peacebuilding and violence prevention, while COVID-19 was noted for straining institutions and limiting civic freedoms. Data gaps remained a major challenge, especially for sensitive targets like illicit flows and freedom of expression. VNRs emphasized the connection between peace, governance, the rule of law, and sustainable development. Countries reported on efforts to strengthen justice systems, promote judicial independence, and fight corruption and terrorism. Participatory approaches, inclusivity, and human rights were seen as essential for social cohesion and development. 2022 The reports also highlighted the importance of international cooperation and transparent governance in supporting economic recovery and implementation of the 2030 Agenda, especially in conflict-affected settings. VNRs prioritized peace and security, highlighting efforts to reduce violence and support conflict prevention. Access to justice and legal identity were central, with reforms expanding legal aid and strengthening civil registration systems. Transparency and accountability continued to be widely addressed. Many countries acknowledged gaps in SDG 16 data and responded by investing in statistical capacity and incorporating citizen-generated and 2023 qualitative data. Institutional integration of SDG 16 into national development plans was a key trend. Countries linked SDG 16 to education, gender equality, climate action, and poverty reduction, acknowledging that inclusive and accountable institutions are the bedrock of sustainable and resilient societies. 7 Graphic percentage of countries Target covered including SDG 16 targets in the Voluntary National Reviews 2016 vs 2024 Target not covered 2016 41% Target 16.1: Violence 2024 100% 2016 45% Target 16.2: Child Protection 2024 92% 2016 64% Target 16.3: Access to Justice 2024 89% 2016 23% Target 16.4: Organized Crime 2024 69% 2016 45% Target 16.5: Corruption 2024 92% 2016 55% Target 16.6: Effective Institutions 2024 94% 9 2016 41% Target 16.7: Inclusive Decision- making 2024 89% 2016 45% Target 16.8: Global Governance 2024 78% 2016 23% Target 16.9: Legal Identity 2024 69% Target 16.10: 2016 55% Fundamental Freedoms 2024 86% 2016 45% Target 16.a: Human Rights Institutions 2024 75% 2016 64% Target 16.b: Discrimination 2024 92% 10 Integration of the SDGs in National Plans and Strategies Institutional arrangements for integrating SDGs in sustainable development plans are a critical issue because they directly affect how effectively countries can deliver commitments related to peace, justice, and strong institutions. Strong and inclusive institutional arrangements are also essential for fostering country ownership, ensuring that SDG 16 priorities are integrated into national strategies and reflect the needs and aspirations of diverse stakeholders. Without such arrangements, accountability, coordination, and sustained progress are likely to remain limited. All the VNR countries for 2024 have embedded SDGs into national strategies, financing frameworks, and policies. The extent to which SDGs have been incorporated into national frameworks varies. Some countries have fully integrated SDGs into their policy plans. Other countries mention that they have integrated the SDGs into their national policy frameworks but offer limited information on the specifics or on the process of integration. Only a small number of countries refer to supporting these strategies with SDG-aligned budgets or Integrated National Financing Frameworks, revealing an ongoing disconnect between stated commitments and actual financing [1]. The list below represents solid examples of how countries are effectively integrating SDGs into their national plans and frameworks.

The innovative ways in which SDG 16 is highlighted reflect the wide range of dynamic approaches available to advance collective commitments to peace, justice, and strong institutions. While countries continue to present progress on the SDGs in different formats, nine years into implementation, we are seeing certain thematic areas of SDG 16 emerging as universally relevant and recognized priorities across diverse national contexts. Yes No Figure 1 - Percentage that had sections/chapters on SDG 16 81% The aspects of SDG 16 that are more prominently highlighted across multiple 2024 VNRs include: Inclusion. Many countries demonstrated a deeper commitment to creating spaces for multi- stakeholder participation. Nearly all VNRs highlighted stakeholder contributions to the 2030 Agenda. These consultations ensured participation from citizens across the country, representing various sectors and identities, from women to youth to indigenous groups. Advancing gender equality, empowering young leaders, and ensuring the civic participation of those impacted by conflict, climate change, and poverty are among the practices that were increasingly highlighted. Localization. Countries are investing more in multi-level governance approaches to development. Among the 2024 VNRs, 33% referenced Voluntary Local Reviews [2] – a significant increase from 16% in 2022 [3]. Some VNRs report that they have or are in the process of establishing local government bodies or are already engaging regularly with rural- based organizations, indigenous communities and faith-based groups to support SDG implementation. SDG 16 Interlinkages. Many countries increasingly acknowledge the interlinkages between SDG 16 and other SDGs. In 2024, several examples of the links between SDG 13 on climate action and SDG 16 are highlighted. Some of the VNRs demonstrate that developing climate policies, such as early warning systems, that involve those most vulnerable to climate disasters, can enhance public trust and promote inclusive governance approaches. The connections between SDG 5 on gender equality and SDG 16 are also increasingly recognized and reinforced. Examples include the implementation of gender budgeting tools, the empowerment of women leaders, and the application of gender-sensitive approaches in peacebuilding efforts. 13 Transparency and anti-corruption. There is a continued focus on reducing corruption and enhancing accountability. 81% of the 2024 VNRs reference anti-corruption measures, fraud, bribery or illicit financial flows as challenges to the achievement of SDGs. Many 2024 VNRs emphasize the role of oversight bodies – such as Supreme Audit Institutions, anti-corruption commissions, ombudsman, and national human rights institutions to reinforce transparency and accountability. The VNRs recognize that although legal and oversight reforms are underway in several countries, political corruption and organized crime continue to have severe and far- reaching impacts. SDG 16 Monitoring and Reporting. The 2024 VNRs mark a notable shift toward inclusive, and innovative SDG 16 data systems. Countries are not only expanding their indicator sets and digital tools but are also recognizing the value of qualitative narratives and citizen-generated data. For instance, Mexico integrates both qualitative insights and citizen-generated data into its SDG 16 reporting, while Kenya incorporates geospatial, administrative, and citizen- generated data into its broader SDG monitoring efforts. Despite these advancements, many countries—particularly fragile states - continue to face significant challenges due to the lack of disaggregated data, underscoring the urgent need for greater support for national statistical systems. Armenia Sierra Leone Armenia’s VNR included a dedicated chapter Sierra Leone’s VNR states that “After being on ‘peace’ that reflects Armenia’s experience an accelerator SDG for the first half of the navigating the impacts of COVID-19, military 2030 agenda, SDG 16 has been further aggression, and a major humanitarian crisis.

The chapter emphasizes Armenia’s National Cohesion in 2021, which has played commitment to governance and judiciary a critical role in fostering political dialogue reforms, the strengthening of democratic and advancing reconciliation. After the 2023 institutions and social protection systems, and general elections, the commission was an uncompromising fight against corruption central in mediating post-election disputes as central pillars of SDG 16 implementation. between the country’s two main political parties and in supporting the implementation Palau of the Tripartite Agreement on electoral reform and governance. Palau’s VNR incorporates SDG 16 into Pillar 2 “Empowering our People” and includes six SDGs (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 16) and 40 targets. Strengthening social protection for vulnerable groups, improving food security, leveraging technology to broaden access to essential services, promoting gender equity in development, and investing in a violence-free future are all key objectives of the Government. 14 Uganda The Solomon Islands Uganda’s VNR places SDG 16 at the core of The Solomon Islands chose five priority SDGs its transformative agenda, identifying six for detailed review – SDG 1, 2, 13, 16, and 17. national commitments to accelerate SDG Within the section on “Peace”, the VNR progress.

It frames these reforms as building. integral to fulfilling the targets of SDG 16, highlighting that strong institutions are key to conflict prevention, social stability, and effective service delivery. 15 Interlinkages between SDG 16 and other SDGs The interlinkages between SDG 16 and other goals are increasingly acknowledged as critical to the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Numerous countries have underscored the importance of strong, inclusive, and accountable institutions as foundational to progress across all sectors. For instance, Austria integrates gender equality, youth engagement, and international cooperation as cross-cutting priorities, applying SDG 16 principles, such as gender-responsive budgeting and anti-violence initiatives, throughout its national agenda. Belize addresses child marriage not only under SDG 5 but also in relation to SDGs 1, 4, 8, 10, and 16, illustrating how sustainable peace and justice are contingent upon the elimination of harmful practices. Similarly, Brazil incorporates transparency, human rights, and corporate accountability into its economic and environmental strategies, thereby reinforcing the synergies between SDG 16 and SDGs 8, 12, and 17. Other Member States are advancing the cross-cutting relevance of SDG 16 through national planning and legislative alignment. Costa Rica has identified hundreds of legislative linkages, with SDG 16 among the most frequently referenced. Honduras emphasizes that enhanced governance contributes to improved outcomes in education, health, and other key sectors. Nepal’s inclusive democratic approach promotes participation, social equity, and environmental commitments, demonstrating the broad applicability of SDG 16 principles. In conflict-affected settings such as South Sudan, SDG 16 is viewed as foundational for rebuilding institutions and needed for progress in areas ranging from education to economic resilience. Spain calls SDG 16 the human rights SDG. It highlights the integration of human rights across all SDGs, positioning SDG 16 both as a standalone objective and as a guiding framework for implementation. Meanwhile, Vanuatu exemplifies the mutually reinforcing relationship between governance and climate action, where investments in local institutions and civic engagement have led to more equitable and resilient climate responses. Collectively, these examples underscore that SDG 16 is not only a goal in its own right, but also a vital enabler of sustainable development across the entire 2030 Agenda. No Yes Figure 2 - Percentage that linked SDG 16 with other SDGs 44% 16 Austria Brazil Austria’s VNR recognizes gender equality as Brazil’s VNR highlights the integration of a foundational pillar for the successful SDG 16 principles, such as transparency, implementation of the 2030 Agenda across integrity, corporate accountability, and human all levels, - local to global. This commitment is rights compliance - within broader sustainable reflected not only in the dedicated targets of development efforts. Through extensive SDG 5, but also in gender-specific goals public consultation, stakeholders emphasized across multiple SDGs, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, the importance of: (i) fair, safe, and inclusive 10, 11, 13, 16, and 17. The VNR identifies three working conditions contributing to decent intersectional priorities: gender equality, work and economic growth (SDG 8), (ii) youth, and international cooperation, sustainable production and reduced embedding them across all SDG areas, environmental impact across value chains including SDG 16. The VNR discusses how (SDG 12), (iii) corporate responsibility gender budgeting is used as a strategic tool grounded in legal compliance and for ensuring SDG coherence with gender transparency (SDG 16), and (iv) strengthened equality. It also discusses policies to combat partnerships with government, civil society, gender-based violence and online hate and private actors to meet national targets speech along with a focus on enhanced care (SDG 17). The VNR notes that Brazil has made services which are core aspects of SDG 16. a concerted effort to link good governance and integrity (SDG 16) with economic, environmental, and collaborative frameworks, Belize enhancing both public trust and policy coherence across the 2030 Agenda. Belize’s VNR demonstrates a strong commitment to eliminating violence against women and girls, guided by the CEDAW framework and supported by the Spotlight Initiative with UN partners. A key feature is the country’s investment in data collection for evidence-based policymaking. For example, the country tracks rising cases of sexual violence to inform targeted interventions. Belize also developed a 2020 Road Map to End Child Marriage and Early Unions, engaging key sectors—health, education, child protection, and economic development —to empower youth decision-making and prevent harmful practices. Importantly, the roadmap links these efforts not only to SDG 5, but also to SDGs 1, 4, 8, 10, and 16, acknowledging that preventing child marriage is critical to sustainable peace, justice, and inclusion. 17 Costa Rica Nepal Costa Rica’s VNR underscores the legislative Nepal’s VNR describes the country’s alignment with the 2030 Agenda, highlighting commitment to “inclusive democracy” which that 1,308 legislative bills were mapped plays a vital role in advancing the 2030 against the SDGs. Notably, SDGs 16 (peace, Agenda. This approach ensures that people justice, and strong institutions), 8 (decent from all backgrounds - especially work and economic growth), and 17 marginalized groups - have a meaningful (partnerships for the goals) account for 41% of voice in governance and decision-making. all linkages, demonstrating a strong Inclusive democracy enables the interconnection between institutional development of equitable public policies that governance and broader sustainable guarantee access to quality education and development priorities. This mapping exercise promotes gender-responsive legislation not only affirms the central role of SDG 16 through increased participation of women in within the legislative agenda but also reflects politics. It also supports inclusive economic its cross-cutting relevance in advancing policies that create jobs, foster fair labor inclusive economic growth and effective practices, and expand opportunities for multi-stakeholder partnerships.

It also facilitates the design and implementation of Honduras environmental and climate policies that integrate the voices of those most at risk. Honduras’ VNR demonstrates a Nepal’s experience illustrates that inclusive comprehensive integration of the SDGs democracy not only advances specific SDGs within its national policy framework, with a —such as SDGs 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 16—but distinct focus on SDG 16. The government also contributes across the 2030 Agenda. has linked multiple public policies - including the National Energy Policy (Política South Sudan Energética Nacional) and the Weaving Social Cohesion 2024-2045 cultural strategy South Sudan’s VNR highlights that South (Tejiendo Cohesión Social 2024–2045) - to a Sudan has prioritized democratic governance broad range of SDGs such as poverty as a central focus. The Revised National eradication, quality education, gender Development Strategy (RNDS) 2021–2024 equality, clean energy, decent work, also identifies SDG 16 as a key priority, innovation, climate action, and strong emphasizing its role as a foundational goal institutions.. SDG 16 stands out as a priority that supports progress across multiple other with 77 programmes linked to it, underscoring SDGs. Honduras’ commitment to strengthening institutions, promoting peace, and enhancing justice systems as foundational pillars for sustainable development. 18 The RNDS is aligned with the implementation Vanuatu of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (R- Vanuatu’s VNR clearly shows how SDG 16 and ARCSS), which aims to maintain peace and climate action (SDG 13) reinforce each other. stabilize the economy.

Spain Spain’s VNR places human rights at the heart of its Agenda 2030 strategy, meaning that the SDGs mirror human rights obligations and that human rights are present in all the goals, bringing the linkages through this one framework. In practice, this means that poverty eradication, access to housing, water, and food; legal obligations are explicitly connected to a human rights-based approach to development. The VNR stresses that human rights, participation, transparency and accountability are foundational principles for all policy design, implementation and evaluation - core aspects of SDG 16 and throughout the entire 2030 Agenda. 19 SDG 16 Data Monitoring and Reporting Half-way through the 2030 Agenda, the SDGs are falling behind their targets. In fact, according to the UN Secretary General’s 2024 SDG Progress Report, progress towards the targets for peace, justice and strong institutions is only moderate or marginal with more than 30% of targets stagnating [5]. In a challenging global context where countries are facing multiple conflicts and crises, urgent acceleration of the SDGs and SDG 16 in particular is crucial. Many of the 2024 VNR countries recognize this urgency and are therefore focusing more on data integrity, monitoring systems, and reporting frameworks. This is demonstrated via the development of expanded indicators sets, digital dashboards, local-level data reviews, and institutional capacity building. Countries are also recognizing that reliable SDG 16 data is essential to enhance accountability mechanisms, draft effective policies and ensure sound implementation. The following are selected 2024 VNRs that are acting on SDG 16 monitoring and reporting. These examples demonstrate that 2024 VNRs are increasingly integrating robust data systems with human rights frameworks, supporting more inclusive, evidence-based approaches to SDG 16. Austria The VNR also noted that SDGs are “systematically incorporated into policy at Austria’s VNR stated that it utilized data from central and local levels,” with 32 of 64 Statistics Austria, which has monitored all 17 municipalities actively engaged in SDG SDGs from 2016 to 2022.

This process is supported by capacity-building initiatives led Georgia by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS). The country’s monitoring process also Georgia’s VNR described the country’s SDG incorporates geospatial, administrative, and Inter-Agency Council and four themed citizen-generated data, including gender- working groups (including Democratic responsive indicators to reflect Kenya’s Governance), which coordinate to align commitment to women’s leadership, SDG 16 indicators with domestic policies. peacebuilding, and inclusive governance. The country included tracking almost all SDG 16 indicators in their reporting. 20 Laos South Sudan and Yemen Laos’s VNR acknowledged regression on South Sudan and Yemen’s VNRs openly SDG 16 due to weak monitoring. It stressed acknowledged limited statistical capacity due the need for a whole-of-government to instability in their VNRs. To address this, the approach, stronger resource mobilization, and South Sudan 2024 VNR emphasized the comprehensive localization to improve data importance of enhanced coordination in the gathering and reporting. implementation and reporting of the SDGs. To support this effort, an interagency committee, Samoa chaired by the Director General of the Ministry of Finance and Planning and co-led Samoa’s VNR addresses challenges in by the National Bureau of Statistics - has been measuring progress on SDG 16, citing limited tasked with establishing a national SDG data and capacity for monitoring justice, dashboard.

The VNR also informs that one of the four actions that the government will take forward to address the current challenges on SDG 16 is to invest in ‘big data’ to provide timely information on fast-evolving development challenges. 21 Zimbabwe Zimbabwe’s VNR standouts for its integration of Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs) – aligning local feedback with national institutional processes. The VLRs conducted in municipalities such as Harare, Victoria Falls, Bulawayo and rural councils provide local assessments that feed data and insights into the national review. This community-led approach helped address data gaps and improve accountability at all levels. Continuous stakeholder-driven reviews contributed to enhanced data collection and transparent monitoring, accountability and inclusion, which are central elements of SDG 16. 22 Annex 1 Annex 1.

    "text": "An Economic Diversification Push for LLDCs Achieving the Awaza PoA Executive Summary: Landlocked developing countries, comprising 32 nations, face unique trade and development challenges due to lack of direct sea access, higher transportation costs, longer transit times, and dependency on neighboring transit countries. Current trade and tariff uncertainties have amplified existing vulnerabilities. LLDCs account for only 1.3% of global exports, 82% of which are unprocessed primary commodities, and face 1.4 times higher trade costs than coastal partners. With this, UNDP’s preliminary analysis shows that tariff impacts are about 4% higher on average for LLDC countries relative to non-LLDCs. This brief summarizes these structural challenges and discusses two evolving scenarios –covering the intensification of existing trade patterns or a strategic push towards economic diversification and opening new trade markets. The Awaza Programme of Action provides a clear roadmap for LLDCs to overcome current challenges by making strategic choices on key trading partners, deepening regional and South-South integration efforts, accelerating digital public infrastructure to improve border trade, and broadening economic diversification efforts. Deliberate policy choices are needed to navigate the current trade and tariff uncertainties.

Economic diversification is hard; the manufacturing in textiles, food processing, or literature shows that few sectors and few chemicals as Chinese firms look for lower-cost countries have successfully diversified their production bases among Belt and Road export baskets (Hausmann et al partners. Beyond manufacturing, a pullback or 2024). However, through strengthened trade export restrictions on critical materials (for systems and regional collaboration, LLDCs may instance, rare earth minerals or certain tech forge a path toward economic diversification, components) might spur importers to seek new competitiveness, and resilience in a rapidly suppliers. An LLDC rich in those resources – changing global trade environment –expanding e.g. Bolivia (lithium) or Niger (uranium) – could upon existing trade markets and goods. find new demand. Additionally, if China shifts its import strategy, LLDCs producing agricultural In this scenario, some of China’s share of global goods or metals could see increased export exports relocate, either due to internal shifts opportunities in the long run (though this (rising wages, focus on domestic consumption) depends on each country’s trade profile). or external pressures (trade restrictions, diversification by importers). A recent study Capturing these opportunities will require highlighted eight emerging economies – LLDCs to overcome competitive gaps. The including Vietnam, India, Indonesia, Mexico, African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and Turkey – as prime beneficiaries of for example, offers a large integrated market manufacturing relocating from China (Zuo, that could support manufacturing in African 2025).

In short, policy reforms, LLDCs risk missing out on a as existing supply chain dominance ebbs, potential wave of industrial opportunity. LLDCs have a window to build up their own export sectors, attract investment, and diversify Opportunities: In a long run relocation scenario, away from commodity dependence. LLDCs would aim to enter global value chains Evolution of Trade with LLDCs An analysis of the value of trade between China and LLDCs in 2024 shows imports from China amounted to about USD 78.3 billion, while exports to China were close USD 50.1 billion. This is compared to 10.55 billion imports from the USA and USD 4.8 billion exports to the USA. Value of Imports from and Exports to China and USA in USD Exports to China from LLDCs have doubled since 2015 but so have imports compared to 2024 at about 78 billion USD. Imports steadily outgrew exports in 2023 and 2024. Compared to the US, the trade between LLDCs and the US has remained relatively stable since 2015 with exports to the USA remaining relatively stagnant. LLDCs currently exports most of its mineral resources to China (about 64% of the exports to China) followed by minerals, metals and products. LLDCs also export vegetable products, chemicals, wood paper, rubber, and plastic valued at more than $1 billion. The major export from LLDCs to the US is minerals, metals and products of about $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2023. With higher tariffs in the USA, there will be less incentives to export to the USA and more incentives to export more to China and other trading partners including the EU. As of July 29, 2025, not much differentiation on sectoral mineral tariffs has been announced by the US. Only copper is subject to a 50% tariff. Strategic Policy Options tied to local job creation and skills transfer. It’s also vital to support domestic entrepreneurs and SMEs in moving up value chains (e.g. A strategic push to diversify products and processing minerals or agricultural products access new markets would allow LLDCs to locally instead of exporting raw). International navigate evolving trade dynamics. These partners can provide Aid for Trade funding and include a mix of proactive and defensive advisory services to build productive capacities strategies. Below are potential policy levers and in these new sectors. Over time, a more initiatives that could bolster LLDC resilience and diversified export basket, including integrate them into shifting supply chains: manufactured goods and services, will make LLDCs less vulnerable to demand shifts from Investments in Trade Facilitation and any single country.

Likewise, This involves improving the business climate – invest in transport infrastructure (roads, rail simplifying regulations, ensuring stable policies, links, dry ports) that connect to seaports or combatting corruption, and improving labor major hubs. Multilateral support can be tapped skills – to meet investor expectations. Public- here: the Vienna Programme of Action (VPoA) private partnerships can be explored to build for LLDCs prioritizes transport, and China’s BRI necessary facilities (e.g. industrial park offers infrastructure funding (to be used infrastructure co-financed by development judiciously). Corridor agreements with transit banks). Additionally, when Chinese firms countries (one-stop border posts, harmonized themselves seek lower-cost locations abroad, regulations) can accelerate improvements in LLDCs (especially those on BRI corridors) infrastructure and translate into faster should capitalize by offering partnership movement of goods. By lowering the “hard” and opportunities. For instance, if a textile firm “soft” infrastructure barriers, LLDCs can opens a factory in an African LLDC, the mitigate their geography-driven disadvantage government can negotiate training programs for and better attract investment. UNDP and local workers and use local inputs to maximize development banks can assist with technical benefits.

This emerging economies (like Vietnam or India) means developing new export sectors and share lessons and potentially invest in LLDCs. higher value products beyond the current The aim is to ensure LLDCs are not overlooked commodity dependence. Governments should in the global supply chain reordering by making identify export pockets where the country has a them part of the solution for diversified latent comparative advantage or could feasibly sourcing. build competitiveness – whether agro- processing, light manufacturing (textiles, Regional Integration and Transit apparel, footwear), or niche services. Targeted Agreements: LLDCs should pursue deeper industrial policies can help, for instance, by regional trade integration to enlarge their market creating special economic zones (SEZs) or size and improve transit routes. In Africa, full industrial parks with reliable infrastructure and implementation of the African Continental Free incentives to lure investors (as Ethiopia did to Trade Area (AfCFTA) will benefit LLDCs by jumpstart textile exports). Incentives should be reducing intra-African tariffs and encouraging infrastructure development along pan-African buffers (e.g. reserve funds or insurance corridors. LLDCs in Africa and Asia should mechanisms) to cope with commodity price actively engage in regional economic swings or sudden drops in export demand. communities and customs unions to harmonize Diversifying trade partners is another hedge – standards and enable regional value chains (so negotiating trade agreements or market access an investor can base in an LLDC and still easily with a wider array of countries (so that serve a regional market of hundreds of millions). dependence on any single buyer like China or Moreover, legally binding transit treaties with the U.S. is reduced). Improving domestic neighbors (covering rights of access to ports, resource mobilization and debt management cross-border transport freedoms, etc.) need to will give LLDCs more stability if external flows be upheld and modernized. International fluctuate. It is also crucial to invest in human support can help monitor and enforce these capital and technology: a more skilled agreements.

By growth. institutionalizing such foresight and flexibility, policymakers can respond swiftly to either Multilateral Support and South-South capitalize on opportunities or cushion shocks.

This requires concerted effort at Economic Resilience and Risk Management: national, regional, and global levels. Economic Finally, given the unpredictability of global trade diversification is hard and in many cases the shifts, LLDCs should strengthen their overall constraints are deeply structural and include resilience. This includes building financial governance bottlenecks and political economy integrating LLDCs into the evolving global trade traps; however, the options presented above landscape. With the right support, even emphasize pragmatic steps: from building roads landlocked countries can find pathways to and border posts to skilling workers and prosperity in a rebalanced world economy, courting investors, to leveraging multilateral turning geographic constraints into support mechanisms. opportunities for innovative connectivity and cooperation. The coming years will be critical to For policymakers, the imperative is clear – ensure that no landlocked nation is left behind channel resources and political will towards by the shifting tides of global trade.

Foreword We present this third joint Global Progress Report on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16—our The new data presented here equips Member States with clearer insights into both the gaps and compass for peaceful, just and inclusive societies—during a time marked by unyielding turbulence. New and opportunities for action. We recognize the enormity of these challenges. But we also see the immense ongoing conflicts rage, violence takes and ruins lives, people are forced to flee their homes and find their potential of coordinated action through the tried-and-tested UN system. This report is an invitation to rights denied and curtailed wherever they go. The rising tide of conflict, combined with unrelenting climate reflect, renew, and rally behind the promise of SDG 16. change and economic upheavals, has created what United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has called, in his Sustainable Development Goals Report 20251, “a global development emergency.” As custodians of global SDG 16 indicators, we reaffirm our commitments to accompany and support Member States towards peace, justice and inclusion, grounded in human rights. Together we can turn the Yet we remain driven by the conviction that there are solutions to these intertwined and collective crises. tide. They are within our reach. They require a renewed, unfaltering focus on SDG 16, the linchpin of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. They require us to set our sights on the targets of Goal 16 with renewed energy, tackling the violence, corruption, injustice and exclusion that hold back progress across all the Goals. Peace, justice and inclusion are not only goals in their own right. They are the foundation for achieving every other Goal. Without systemic protections—universal access to justice, the rule of law, and accountable governance— efforts to eradicate poverty, combat inequality or respond to climate emergencies lose their moorings. Conversely, when SDG 16 is placed front and centre, it can become a catalyst for real change. Strengthened justice systems help deliver better health, education and environmental outcomes. Accountable institutions underpin effective environmental governance. Inclusive, non-discriminatory decision-making consistent with international human rights standards strengthens social cohesion, boosting resilience to national and global shocks. This report brings together the latest available data on all of the internationally agreed SDG 16 indicators, to ask: what story do the numbers tell? The multifaceted nature of SDG 16 is reflected in the diversity of agencies responsible for gathering data and compiling these indicators. And this report is testament to these agencies’ commitment to working together as part of the United Nations family to bring about change. This year’s report also shines a special spotlight on the situation of displaced populations, illustrating through data how failures to fulfil the promise of Goal 16 lie at the heart of the forced displacement crisis. We are grateful to all our partners who contributed to this report, and who share our dedication to achieving Goal 16 and the entire 2030 Agenda. This shared dedication, rooted in human rights and anchored in solidarity, must continue to drive us forward. The 80th anniversary of the United Nations invites reflection: we are striving to achieve not just a set of time-bound goals, but a vision for humanity. The opening lines of our United Nations Charter reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, justice and equality: the very same principles that sit at the heart of Goal 16. We stand united in urging Member States, parliaments, civil society, national justice and human rights Volker Türk Ghada Waly Haoliang Xu institutions, international and local partners to accelerate efforts. We must focus both on reaching the United Nations High Executive Director, Acting Administrator & targets of Goal 16 and on strengthening the data systems needed to provide evidence for informing and Commissioner for Human Rights UNODC UNDP Associate Administrator monitoring decisions.

Indicators on Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies. Legal protections for access to information Preventing discrimination Introduction The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development set out a vision of peaceful, just, and inclusive societies, grounded in human rights. Goal 16 is central to realizing this vision and serves as a foundation for all other Sustainable Development Goals. However, nearly a decade into implementation, data reveal that not a single target under Goal 16 is fully on track. This challenge is shared by Goals 1 (no poverty), 5 (gender equality) and 6 (clean water and sanitation). Progress under Goal 16 remains uneven, fragile, and in many areas too slow to meet the ambition of the agreed Agenda. Still, there are important gains to recognize. Over the past five years alone, homicide rates have edged downward. More than 500 million children under five have had their births registered, closing long-standing gaps in the realization of the right to legal identity. Access to information —legally guaranteed by specific laws in 139 countries today—opens new pathways for transparency and accountability. Accredited national human rights institutions in 114 countries now cover more than 60 per cent of the world’s population. Two In 2025, the right to information is legally New evidence from 119 countries reveals groups thirds of citizens report satisfaction with essential government services. Three quarters of seized firearms guaranteed in 139 countries, a remarkable increase most discriminated against and an upward trend in are now potentially traceable—an important step in curbing illicit arms flows. from just 14 countries in 1990. This global progress global experience of discrimination. On average, highlights a growing international commitment to one in five individuals globally report having been Yet these gains are precarious, and in some cases overshadowed by worsening realities. Civilian deaths in transparency, accountability, and the role of access discriminated against on at least one ground conflict have surged since 2022, with one life lost every 12 minutes in 2024. Progress towards gender parity to information in supporting the SDGs. prohibited by international law in the past 12 in representation in parliaments, public service and judiciaries remains too slow. Access to justice remains months, with most countries reporting prevalence elusive for too many: one third of the global prison population is still held in prolonged pre-trial detention, rates between 13 and 26 per cent. Persons in least and fewer than half of victims of violent assault report it to authorities. Discrimination—affecting one in developed countries report higher discrimination five people globally, with higher rates among women, the poor, and persons with disabilities—appears on rates, on average (24.3 per cent), compared to other the rise. The share of people who feel unsafe has not improved. Two out of three children are subjected to country groupings. violent discipline, and millions report sexual abuse. In fragile settings, one in four girls experienced rape or sexual assault in childhood. At least one human rights defender or journalist was killed or disappeared every 14 hours last year. Less than half of people living in high- and middle-income countries believe that their country’s political system enables them to have a say in government decisions or that their voices influence policy outcomes. These setbacks strike at the very foundations of peaceful, just and inclusive societies, impeding progress across other Sustainable Development Goals. The report further highlights how the lack of advancement on SDG 16 is fuelling a steady rise in forced displacement, with 123.2 million people fleeing conflict, persecution, violence, and other human rights violations in 2024: an increase of more than 50 per cent compared to 2020. Data gaps compound these challenges, leaving countries without a clear compass to guide policy and measure progress. For many indicators, data remain insufficient or not disaggregated enough to capture who is most at risk of being left behind. Yet, there is reason for cautious optimism: a decade of collaborative efforts has expanded the evidence base for Goal 16, with more indicators now regularly reported and more internationally endorsed methodologies in place. As of the 2025 reporting cycle, 56 per cent of countries had reported data on at least one Goal 16 target since 2015, up from 40 per cent in 2023 and just 23 per cent in 2019. The lesson is clear: accelerating progress on Goal 16 is imperative. Peaceful, just and inclusive societies are the bedrock on which all other dimensions of sustainable development rely. Advancing this Goal requires effective actions at national level as well as strengthened international cooperation.

Indicators on Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies. This report consolidates the latest evidence to guide collective action. Structured around the core dimensions of Goal 16, it underscores both the urgency of the moment and the deep interconnection between peace, justice, and inclusion within the 2030 Agenda. SDG 16 and human rights: an inextricable link The success of SDG 16, as for the 2030 Agenda in its entirety, depends on grounding its implementation firmly in human rights. The indivisibility and universality of human rights are not only foundational to SDG 16 but also essential for its realization. There is no single blueprint for achieving all the SDG 16 targets, diverse and wide-ranging as they are. But by viewing the core dimensions of the Goal — peace, justice and inclusion — as well as the need for robust evidence, from the perspective of internationally-agreed human rights obligations, we can carve out a path towards fulfilling both these human rights obligations and the development targets of Goal 16. Peace cannot be sustained without respect for human dignity. Addressing the root causes of violence, conflict, and forced displacement must align with States’ duties under international human rights law. This includes measures that uphold and protect the supreme right — the right to life — in all its civil, political, economic, and social dimensions. a Justice depends upon equal enjoyment of rights and access to remedies. Adhering to the Peaceful Societies international human rights normative framework ensures that justice systems are not only accessible but also fair and responsive to the needs of all. b Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development Inclusion, likewise, demands the active participation of all individuals, especially those most marginalized, in shaping the institutions and decisions that affect their lives. Efforts towards achieving targets in this area must aim to mobilize the maximum available resources of countriesc and to leave no one behind, without discrimination of any kind, whether based on race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or other status. d Reliable, disaggregated data are critical to both human rights assessment and SDG 16 implementation. Evidence is essential to reveal patterns of inequality, identify gaps in access to justice, track progress toward peaceful and inclusive societies, and call out governments and institutions when they veer away from the right path. Data efforts must be aligned with the human rights-based approach to data, in which all aspects of the design, collection, processing and dissemination of data respect human rights obligations. Enhancing capacity and collaboration in data collection and dissemination is vital to improve the measurement of SDG 16 and end the invisibility of marginalized groups. e Peace cannot endure without justice.

Reducing the number of intentional homicides – that is, `unlawful deaths inflicted upon fear. Violence, whether in armed conflicts, in communities or hidden behind the walls of homes, takes lives, persons with the intent to cause death or serious injury` – is crucial to meet this target. This is because destroys livelihoods, curtails the enjoyment of human rights, creates fear and stifles progress. homicidal violence is responsible for many more deaths worldwide than armed conflict and terrorism combined2 . Intentional homicide can be considered the ultimate crime, which not only blights the lives Conflict is also the principal root cause of forced displacement, resulting in the loss not only of homes of the victim’s family and community, but also creates a violent environment that negatively impacts on and communities, but also of enjoyment of rights such as education, health, and adequate housing.

Although the rate of intentional homicide remains much higher for men than women, the homicide rate for men dropped by 14 per cent from 2015 to 2023, while the female rate dropped by only 5 per cent over the same period. While in 2023 close to 90 per cent of male homicides were committed outside the home, 60 per cent of female homicides were committed by intimate partners or family members.

This poses a significant challenge for monitoring SDG Target 16.1, which seeks to reduce all forms of violence and related death rates. Casualty recording—the rigorous documentation of patterns of harm to civilians—plays a vital role in monitoring human rights violations. It involves granular data collection, including victim and perpetrator identities, dates, locations, and weapons of violence. However, this essential work is often impeded by information blackouts, population displacement, infrastructure collapse, surveillance, and security risks to data collectors. Despite these barriers, OHCHR remains mandated to protect civilians and uphold their rights. In response, methodological innovations rooted in data science have been integrated into human rights monitoring to enhance both data completeness and accuracy. In many conflict zones, multiple independent sources—civil society records, hospital and morgue data, government and prison registries, and OHCHR’s own documentation—often contain overlapping but incomplete information. Some victims appear in several datasets; others in none. This is where data science becomes indispensable. shtaed fo rebmuN +258% ​ 50,000 -25% +30% 45,000 -43% 40,000 35,000 2015-16 2017-18 2019-20 2021-22 2023-24 30,000 Children (Both sexes) Female (All ages) 25,000 Source: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). 20,000 15,000 10,000 5,000 0 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 International human rights law includes special provisions for the protection of women and children.

Of those, 8 in 10 children and 7 in 10 women killed in the conflicts occurred in Gaza.

Available data shows women and men are not impacted by the same type of violence. The median prevalence of sexual violence in countries with data is 3.0 per cent for women compared to just 0.4 per cent for men. However, the median prevalence of physical violence is 4.1 per cent for men as compared to 3.2 per cent for women. An important form of physical violence is robbery. The median prevalence rate of robbery in the 18 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, at 4.5 per cent, is significantly higher than in the other regions. Trend data on the prevalence of physical assault, another form of physical violence, shows a decrease in 19 out of the 29 countries with at least one data point for the period 2010-2016 and one data point for the period 2017-2024.

Violence puts a Source: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). broad array of human rights at risk, from the right to life to rights to health and education to mention just a few. Measuring the prevalence of this non-lethal violence is challenging because victims of such violence do not always report their experience to the authorities, with clear implications for access to justice and redress. For example, the median proportion of victims of sexual assault that reported their experience to the authorities was 15 per cent in countries with data in the period 2010-2024. To accurately measure the prevalence of physical, sexual, and psychological violence in the population, it is therefore necessary to conduct surveys or survey modules that are specifically designed to collect this kind of sensitive information.

By contrast, the median proportion of women subjected to sexual violence in the 12 months prior to the survey is higher than that for men, at 3.0 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively.

This worldwide average has remained relatively stable from 2017 to 2024. However, some differences in perceptions of safety are evident between regions.

Violence occurs in many settings, including the home, school, community and over the Internet. Similarly, a wide range of perpetrators commit violence against children, such as family members, intimate partners, teachers, neighbours, strangers and other children10. Although the inclusion of a dedicated SDG target on ending violence against children draws much needed attention to the importance of preventing and responding to the issue as essential to ensuring just and peaceful societies, many countries still lack basic data on violence against children.

Population coverage is above 70 per cent for all SDG regions, except Northern Africa and Western Asia, where coverage was below 50 per cent. While coverage is high globally and in most regions, it is important to note that the quality of data is not uniform. The data sources used to derive the estimates include two categories. Tier 1 data sources are nationally representative household surveys with broadly comparable data that are included in the official global database for SDG indicator 16.2.3. Tier 1 data sources for the majority of countries are either DHS or MICS, both of which are multi-topic household surveys implemented as part of a standardized international survey programme. To complement this, available data from other nationally representative surveys were used (that is, tier 2 sources). These included domestic violence surveys, school-based surveys, surveys on child maltreatment and violence, and regional surveys on violence against women, which also met some predefined criteria. 11 United Nations Children’s Fund, A Familiar Face: Violence in the lives of children and adolescents, UNICEF, New York, 2017. 12 United Nations Children’s Fund, Ten facts about violence against children, UNICEF, New York, 2024. 13 UNICEF global databases, 2025. 14 United Nations Children’s Fund, A Familiar Face: Violence in the lives of children and adolescents, UNICEF, New York, 2017. 15 All estimates from United Nations Children’s Fund, When Numbers Demand Action: Confronting the global scale of sexual violence against children, UNICEF, New York, 2024.

Political will and commitment must be mobilized to ensure the effective monitoring and evaluation of interventions in this regard. Violence against children The widespread prevalence of violence against children around the world reveals a profound failure to uphold children’s rights and protect their wellbeing. A crucial first step towards ending all forms of violence against children is documenting its scope through high-quality, regular, and reliable data collection. Governments and international partners must work to document the prevalence of violence in all its forms as well as the social and structural factors that perpetuate it. Efforts should be gender- and age-responsive, recognizing the distinct forms of risk, exploitation, and harm. This includes developing and implementing strategies against trafficking tailored to the realities children face in different regions and contexts. Standardized definitions and methods to ensure comparability across countries and regions are critical for effective policy making. Abuse, exploitation and human trafficking 19 UNODC. 2024.

The scale of sexual violence against whom, when, where, and why, OHCHR’s efforts are intensifying to strengthen data collection and partner children, in particular, has long been difficult to quantify, due to stigma, measurement challenges and with other data providers. limited investments in data collection. Systematic investments in robust data generation on the issue have rarely received the same priority as other issues on which statistics are produced regularly by governments. The number of conflict situations covered by OHCHR data for SDG indicator 16.1.2 (conflict-related deaths) has increased over recent years and now extends to 16 armed conflicts. In 2024 the coverage expanded to While the last two decades have seen a proliferation of measurement activities aimed to include two additional situations of conflict (Lebanon and the Philippines). Yet there is a continuous need to fill existing data gaps on violence against children, these efforts have often remained sporadic and limited keep improving the counting of civilian deaths and to cover other conflict situations in which there is a large in scope. And while more data on the issue are available, they are often not comparable, largely due to number of fatalities. differences in the definitions used to classify acts as violence and variations in implementation and data collection protocols. Underreporting of experiences of violence against children is common and can be Producing statistics on the killing and disappearance of HRDs (indicator 16.10.1) requires meticulous, attributed to a variety of reasons, including the existence of social norms and stigma, discomfort during collaborative work to record, validate and analyse cases.

Significant progress was made to improve data availability in 2024, including expanding the scope of the data recorded to include cases In a positive development in the face of these challenges, UNICEF developed the International of detention and torture; and doubling the country-level coverage.

Indicators on Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies. Just Societies To achieve lasting peace, security and sustainable development we need systems in place that we can all depend upon: stable, accountable and rights-respecting. We should be able to trust that life around us is governed by fair and inclusive laws; that these laws will be developed, enforced and assessed in a way that ensures the protection and fulfilment of human rights for all; and that they will be upheld reliably and equitably, without discrimination or favour. Access to justice and the rule of law are not just ideals; they are essential safeguards for human rights, enabling societies to function fairly and allowing individuals to claim their entitlements and seek redress when those rights are violated. Access to justice is a fundamental human right affirmed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights though several articles that emphasize equality before the law, the right to effective remedy, and the right to a fair trial. While there is no single definition of access to justice, it is broadly concerned with the ability of people to defend and enforce their rights and obtain just resolution of their legal problems25. When justice systems fray—when survivors of violence are reluctant to report abuse because they fear retaliation or inaction, when they lose trust that their complaints will be handled appropriately through legal channels, or when they see laws being circumvented in favour of personal and political interests— the collective drive towards progress can falter. The very foundations of social trust and democratic Just Societies governance can begin to erode. In the face of unjust and unequal application of rules, fear of detention and risk of retribution, the ability and motivation to strive for a better world can be diminished. Provide access to justice for all Corruption and organized crime further weaken the social contract by diverting resources away from legitimate activities that promote development. Justice, therefore, is not a mere technical component of governance: it is a cornerstone of human rights protection and a driver of sustainable development. National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) have a crucial role to play in safeguarding just societies. When properly resourced, independent from government, and empowered with a suitable breadth and strength of mandate, they can act as a vital bridge between state institutions and the communities they serve, promoting and protecting human rights, seeking justice and working to counter behaviours and attitudes that impede the achievement of just societies. This chapter examines how we are doing in the quest for justice across all areas of life. It drills down to see what the data show us about the rule of law and access to justice, the illegal movement of arms and finances across borders, and the extent of corruption in public life. It also considers the presence and strength of NHRIs as critical actors in promoting fair, inclusive and rights-based societies.

Available data for the period 2010-2024 in countries with data show that the median proportions of victims of physical assault and robbery in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to competent authorities were 35 per cent and 45 per cent, respectively. The median proportion of victims of sexual assault who reported their victimization was 15 per cent in a different set of countries with data26. Sex-disaggregated data on the reporting of physical assault also shows that countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have a higher proportion of female victims than male victims reporting their victimization to competent authorities, while countries in other regions do not exhibit this consistent gap in reporting rates between men and women.

Physical assault is the form of violence with the highest number of countries having sex-disaggregated data on the proportion of victims in the previous 12 months who reported their victimization to competent authorities. These data for the period 2014–202328 suggest some region specific patterns: In all 11 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean with data, a greater proportion of female victims of physical assault reported their victimization compared to male victims. By contrast, such a gap in the reporting rate between the sexes is not evident in the other regions.

The global prison population was estimated at 11.7 million individuals in 2023, representing a global prison-population rate of 145 prisoners per 100,000 population. A third (3.7 million) of the global prison population was held in pre-trial detention, a share that has remained stable between 2015 and 2023. Sex-disaggregated data on the reporting of violence are limited, and only reveal a clear pattern in Latin America and the Caribbean, where women are more likely to report their experiences of physical assault than men While no single indicator can precisely capture the complex and multifaceted nature of rule of law and access to justice, the percentage of pre-trial (‘unsentenced’) detainees within the prison population can serve as a proxy indicator for measuring access to legal aid, the efficiency of the criminal justice system and captures one of the many dimensions of access to justice29. This measure signifies overall respect for the principle that persons awaiting trial should not be detained in custody unnecessarily, which, in turn, is premised on aspects of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty30 and the rights to due Europe and Northern America (11 countries) Latin America and the Caribbean (11 countries) Sub-Saharan Africa (13 countries) Other regions (16 countries) process and freedom from arbitrary detention. It also often reflects the (lack of) access to a lawyer and/or legal aid which is an essential tool to ensure that pre-trial detention is only used where appropriate and that delays in the criminal justice system are reduced. In 2023, an estimated 11.7 million people were held in detention worldwide, five per cent more than a decade ago. While the global prison population has grown over recent decades, the rate of increase has been slower than the growth of the world’s population. As a result, between 2015 and 2023 the global prisoner-to-population ratio has fallen from 149 to 145 prisoners per 100,000 population. The prisoner-to-population ratio varies across regions and, in 2023, the lowest level of 54 prisoners per 100,000 population was observed in Central Asia and Southern Asia, followed by Sub-Saharan Africa (82 prisoners per 100,000 population). The highest ratio of 305 prisoners per 100,000 population was observed in the Latin America and the Caribbean followed by Europe and Northern America (257 prisoners per 100,000 population). Between 2015 and 2023, in some regions, imprisonment rates increased significantly, from 259 to 305 prisoners per 100,000 population in Latin America and the Caribbean and from 137 to 160 per 100,000 population in Northern Africa and Western Asia. The opposite trend was observed in Europe and Northern America, where the prisoner-to-population rate decreased from 326 to 257 prisoners per 100,000 population over the same period, still remaining much higher than the global average. Men make up over 94 per cent of the prison population, or 11.0 million prisoners in 2023, while less than a million (760,000) women were held in prison. The share of women among all prisoners has remained Men relatively stable between 2015 and 2023, staying below 7 per cent during the entire period. However, the share of female prisoners shows some regional variations, ranging from 3.3 per cent in Northern Africa and Western Asia to 8.3 per cent in Europe and Northern America, in 2023. 29 United Nations System Common Position on Incarceration, p.3 30 See United Nations Standards Minimum Rules for Non-Custodial Measures (the Tokyo Rules), rule 6.1 Global Progress Report on Sustainable Development Goal 16 Global Progress Report on Sustainable Development Goal 16 50 51 Indicators on Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies.

The paper defines unmet justice needs as unmet needs that arise when people cannot defend or enforce their rights, or obtain a just resolution of their justiciable problems: 1) people who cannot obtain justice for everyday civil, administrative, or criminal jus- tice problems; 2) people who are excluded from the opportunities the law provides; and 3) people who live in extreme conditions of injustice. Estimates were produced using legal needs survey data collected by the World Justice Project in 102 countries and territories (representing 90.6 per cent of the world’s population), data gathered by the Hague Institute for Innovation of Law in two countries, and extrapolations for 114 countries and territories without legal needs survey data. For these countries and territories, the proportion of the population with unmet legal needs was imputed based on the average of countries in the same region and income group.

For example, in needing to both respond to information requests and trace the illicit weapons flows Sub-Saharan Africa, Mauritius recorded a population bribery prevalence of 5 per cent in 2017, while the Democratic Republic of the Congo recorded a rate of 80 per cent in 2018: 16 times higher. In the Figure 26: International firearms tracing requests (2022-2023) period 2010-2016, the median population bribery prevalence at the global level stood at 12.2 per cent, while the corresponding figure was 16.0 per cent in the period 2017-2024, suggesting relative stability Tracing requests (submitted/received) Tracing requests responded Successful/matching tracing in global trends.

They can also help to identify specific institutions, businesses and population groups that are most exposed to corruption51. As a result, these surveys have direct policy implications: they can guide national authorities on where to focus their anti-corruption efforts. However, it is also important to note that experience-based corruption surveys cannot capture cases of “grand corruption” among political and business elites. Instead, they capture the everyday experiences of ordinary citizens and businesses when accessing public services. Globally, 142 countries and territories have data on population bribery prevalence for 2024 or the latest year available since 2010. These data indicate that bribery prevalence varies significantly between regions. For example, in countries with data in Central and Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the median bribery prevalence in the population is at 24.0 per cent. By contrast, this figure falls to 15.7 per cent in Eastern and SouthEastern Asia and 9.0 in Europe and Northern America. 48 Among 100 States which submitted national reports for the Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons International Tracing Instrument (PoA/ITI) in 2024, 36 States provided information on diversion incidents related to international transfers or national stockpile management, including details on 6 incidents. 50 The former is henceforth referred to as “population bribery prevalence” and the latter is referred to as “business bribery prevalence”. 49 The total of tracing requests submitted and received are 673 and 4,489 respectively in 2022, whereas 4,483 and 6,409 51 For more information, see: UNODC, Manual on Corruption Surveys (Vienna, 2018); UNODC, Statistical framework to measure respectively in 2023, according to the 2024 PoA national reports. corruption (Vienna, 2023) Global Progress Report on Sustainable Development Goal 16 Global Progress Report on Sustainable Development Goal 16 60 61 Indicators on Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies.

In Nigeria, three successive nation-wide corruption surveys, each covering more than 30,000 households, have revealed the When analysing bribery experienced by the population and bribery experienced by businesses together, specific types of public officials that are most at risk of engaging in bribery when interacting with a clear correlation can be established between the two53.

Note: Population bribery prevalence refers to the proportion of the population that experienced at least one bribe payment request when in contact with public officials during the previous 12 months. Business bribery incidence refers to the share of businesses who experienced at least one bribe payment request in the previous 12 months. The denominator of the population bribery prevalence rate only includes those who had at least one contact with a public official in the previous 12 months, while the denominator of the business bribery incidence rate includes all businesses, regardless of whether they had contact with a public official or not. )%( ecnelaverp yrebirb noitalupoP Countries with high rates of population bribery also record high rates of business bribery, Protective institutions suggesting a shared underlying pattern of corruption • Independent Human Rights institutions (16.a.1 Existence of independent national human rights institu- tions in compliance with the Paris Principles) Independent National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) are crucial for advancing sustainable development in line with human rights standards. Since 2015, the number of countries with NHRIs that comply fully (A status) with the Paris Principles, the internationally agreed minimum standards of accreditation for NHRIs, has grown from 70 to 89, covering 46 per cent of UN Member States and observers. This means that 55 per cent of the world’s population now lives in a country with an independent NHRI. The establishment of independent NHRIs is a cornerstone of human rights promotion and protection and is crucial for supporting SDG progress in line with human rights standards. All Member States are strongly encouraged to establish and empower NHRIs, with resolutions of the Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly giving weight to these calls. The Paris Principles54 are a set of globally agreed minimum standards that NHRIs must meet to be considered legitimate and credible and to be able to carry out their role effectively. The three pillars of the Paris Principles – pluralism, independence and effectiveness—underpin requirements related to, among other things, the breadth of the NHRI’s mandate, its legal and actual independence from government, the adequacy of its resourcing, and the powers it has to act. Crucially, accreditation of NHRIs, i.e. the Business bribery incidence (%) determination of whether or not and how far they meet these principles, is undertaken not by any external or supranational body but by a peer review process. Following the recent additions of Sweden, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Uruguay to the ranks of those with A-status, by 2024, 89 countries worldwide had an NHRI that is fully compliant with the Paris Principles. 54 per cent of the world’s population now lives in a country with a fully compliant NHRI - a significant milestone in progress towards this SDG 16 target. The growth in fully compliant NHRIs has been remarkable over the past two decades. In 2000, only 32 such institutions existed, but the number has nearly tripled since then. In 2024, there were also 25 countries with NHRIs holding B-status accreditation, signifying partial compliance with the Paris Principles. This brings the total number of countries with accredited NHRIs to 114, representing 58 per cent of Member States and observers, and covering 61 per cent of the world’s population. However, despite this steady growth, the current pace remains insufficient to meet the call of the 2030 Agenda. The decline in B-status institutions over time has not translated systematically into A-status gains, indicating that some NHRIs have lost accreditation rather than achieving full compliance. Acceleration in new accreditations and higher status accreditations is essential to achieve the global target. 54 See https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/principles-relating-status-national-institutions-paris Global Progress Report on Sustainable Development Goal 16 Global Progress Report on Sustainable Development Goal 16 64 65 Indicators on Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies.

Indicators on Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies. The latest state of data on just societies Measuring progress towards the SDGs has not been a simple matter of selecting a static set of indicators at the adoption of the 2030 Agenda. The statistical and development communities continue to examine where there are still gaps in our knowledge and how they can be filled. This is why Member States adopted a new indicator (16.3.3) on access to civil justice. The new indicator was adopted in March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic was unfolding. The pandemic severely hampered statistical systems’ capacity to conduct population surveys and compile data for this new indicator, making it difficult to assess global progress. However, despite these initial setbacks and constraints in data collection, there has been an encouraging increase in the number of countries that have begun to collect data and report on this indicator or that are planning data collection activities and reporting. Some countries are already making significant advances by conducting legal needs surveys that include the required questions to compute SDG 16.3.3, or by integrating access to justice survey modules in broader governance surveys. Currently, data for the new indicator are available for ten countries. In early 2025, UNODC, in collaboration with the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and national partners, has started the implementation of the Statistical Framework to Measure Corruption57 in Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Kenya. The aim of this initiative is to foster collaboration between national statistical offices and anti-corruption agencies and to improve the availability of policy-relevant statistics on corruption based on national anti-corruption priorities, including disaggregated data on SDG indicator 16.5.1 (bribery prevalence). Inclusive Societies A 2023 survey among Member States revealed that poor data availability and lack of institutional collaboration represent major obstacles for reporting on indicator 16.4.1 on illicit financial flows. Thanks to co-custodian support, UNCTAD and UNODC, in 2023 countries started reporting the first official estimates of crime-related IFFs (drug trafficking, smuggling of migrants, trafficking in persons) in the Build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels Global SDG Indicator Database. At least two countries are expected to report their first estimates of tax and commercial IFFs in 2025. Pilot activities carried out by UNCTAD, UNODC and UN Regional Commissions underline the need for significant investments in digital and data capacities to speed up tracking and reporting on IFFs. 57 Available at: https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/corruption/UNODC_Statistical_Framework_to_ measure_corruption.pdf Photograph by: Giulia Bertelli Global Progress Report on Sustainable Development Goal 16 Global Progress Report on Sustainable Development Goal 16 70 71 Indicators on Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies.

With the right investments, governments can use technology to improve service delivery and ensure no one is left behind. Accessible digital tools help close service gaps, give people a voice, and make governments more responsive. In Ghana, the UNDP Global Policy Centre for Governance (GPCG) partnered with the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) to pilot a new approach for measuring satisfaction with public services. The initiative used citizen data: information generated through initiatives that engage citizens across the various stages of the data value chain. Launched in the Ga East and Suhum districts, the pilot explored how citizen data could complement official statistics and existing statistical methodologies for measuring satisfaction with public services and asked how such data can add value to governance efforts and SDG 16 monitoring, particularly by capturing the experiences of hard-to-reach populations.

The legislative part of SDG indicator 16.7.1 aims to measure how well the general population is represented in key decision-making positions in national parliaments, focusing on women and youth. Specifically, it looks at representation in three roles: MPs, Speakers of parliament, and chairs of permanent committees on foreign affairs, defence, finance, human rights and gender equality. Inclusive decision-making Target 16.7 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes that responsive, inclusive, Parliaments are where laws are debated, where budgets are allocated and where the executive branch of participatory and representative decision making at all levels is necessary to achieve more peaceful, just government is held to account. Parliaments actively shape the laws, policies, budgets and institutions that and inclusive societies.

While the descriptive representation64 of various demographic groups, including women, provides a basic Representation builds trust. When decision makers do not reflect the people they serve, there is a risk measure of inclusion, the concept of representation extends beyond this. Representation matters not of policies ignoring the needs of large parts of society, creating a disconnect that can erode trust in only from a normative perspective, as a question of fairness and equal rights, but also from a substantive government. Certain policy areas are particularly important to women and young people, who may feel perspective as it shapes policy priorities and outcomes, public trust in institutions, and institutional that issues vital to their lives are ignored – or are insufficiently addressed – by older or male politicians. legitimacy.

Gender parity in these roles has so far primarily been achieved in high-income countries, while middle and low-income countries continue to struggle with unequal representation. Women are disproportionately concentrated in clerical and administrative positions in public service and in low- level courts within the judiciary, while they remain notably underrepresented in senior government positions and in high-level, constitutional and supreme courts. Gender is the only demographic characteristic for which global data on representation in public service and the judiciary are available.

The mere presence of women in public institutions, whether in the parliament, public service or the judiciary does not necessarily translate into influence over decision-making. For representation to be meaningful, women must hold decision-making positions, participate actively and shape the political agenda and public life, i.e. act in the interest of those represented - known as substantive representation. Disaggregated data by level of court and public service positions from selected countries with available data provide invaluable insights and understanding into the career advancement challenges and leadership roadblocks women may face within these institutions. Women are disproportionately concentrated in clerical and administrative positions in public service and in low-level courts within the judiciary.

Designed as a voluntary certification programme, the Seal provides a structured framework for public institutions to assess their internal practices, identify gaps, and implement transformative changes that embed gender equality across all areas of work, from leadership and staffing to budgeting and service delivery. At the heart of the Seal is the principle that institutional change must be evidence-based. Participating institutions begin the process by conducting a comprehensive self-assessment using a set of rigorous standards and indicators. This data-driven approach allows them to map the current state of gender equality within the organization, looking at who holds power, how resources are allocated, whether services meet the needs of all groups, and whether internal systems are fair and inclusive. The insights gained from this diagnostic phase form the foundation for action plans and reform strategies that are tailored to the institution’s specific context and challenges. The Seal has been rolled out in a diverse range of countries, each offering powerful examples of how data and institutional commitment can drive lasting change. For example, in El Salvador, the Ministry of Environment used the Seal to mainstream gender across climate and environmental policy, while the Ministry of Culture created gender units and new accountability mechanisms. Tunisia has incorporated the Seal into its broader public administration reform efforts, using it to address representation gaps and enhance gender-sensitive recruitment and promotion practices. SDG target 16.7 calls for a transformation in public institutions, from top-down systems to ones that are What makes the Gender Equality Seal especially innovative is that it turns abstract goals into truly inclusive, representative, and responsive to the needs of all segments of society. This has far-reaching tangible institutional commitments, supported by clear benchmarks, capacity-building, and regular implications for how governments design institutions and engage citizens. The underrepresentation of monitoring. women, young people, persons with disabilities, and marginalized groups in leadership roles, revealed by these indicators and other available data, must be tackled. *For more information see www.gendersealpublicinstitutions.org Aligning political and administrative incentives is also necessary.

One contributing factor is the widening agency gaps - the growing disparity between people’s aspirations or potential to act and their actual ability to influence decisions and outcomes in their lives or societies80. These gaps are evident from the fact that only half of the global population feels in control of their lives81and less than half of the population feel they have influence over the decisions of their governments. Closing these gaps requires that institutions and governments become more inclusive and responsive. Focusing on high-income countries only, where data coverage is strongest, reveals a positive correlation between people’s perceptions of their ability to influence government decisions and the overall level of human development of a country as measured by the Human Development Index (HDI). People living in countries with higher HDI perceive institutions to be more inclusive and responsive to their needs. To address low perceptions of political efficacy, governments need to adopt a comprehensive approach that enhances civic capacity by improving people’s knowledge, skills, and tools to engage in politics and public life while ensuring inclusive governance so that women, youth, minorities, and marginalized groups see themselves reflected in decision-making. Engagement must move beyond symbolism and create real opportunities for people to influence policies and decisions. Mechanisms such as public consultations, participatory budgeting, citizen assemblies, youth councils and community forums should carry real influence. Legal and policy reforms are essential to enable the full participation of all groups in society. This means eliminating discriminatory laws and practices and enacting frameworks that actively promote inclusion such as gender quotas or parity laws to increase women’s representation, legislation that guarantees political participation for persons with disabilities through accessible voting and candidacy procedures, 79 UNDP (United Nations Development Programme). 2025.

Legal protections for access to information A growing international commitment to transparency and accountability is reflected in increasing legal guarantees for access to information • Public access to information (16.10.2 Number of countries that adopt and implement constitutional, statutory and/or policy guarantees for public access to information) Figure 48: Jurisdictions with legal guarantees for access to public information, as a share of jurisdictions responding to UNESCO survey, 2020-2024 In 2025, the right to information is legally guaranteed in 139 countries, a remarkable increase from just 14 countries in 1990.

UNESCO's recommendations and support for Member States are grounded in data from its annual survey, which provides a comprehensive global assessment of access to information. These data enable governments and stakeholders to develop informed policies that strengthen the right to information The 2024 round of the survey revealed four main findings: through a holistic approach, integrating legal guarantees, independent oversight, innovative digital solutions, and inclusive strategies. 1. Countries with specialized oversight bodies perform better than those without The survey asks countries about a range of areas detailing the existence and implementation of ATI 2. Record-keeping remains one of the major areas for improvement. It is essential to ensure adequate guarantees. It asks whether access guarantees exist; whether an oversight body is mandated; and if so, and reliable records of the requests for information and the appeals received—since only by tracking what roles it serves; whether these agencies are mandated to appoint public information officers; and this information can processes be improved. whether exemptions to the law are well-defined. On implementation of ATI guarantees, the survey asks about record-keeping and statistics, reporting and training. Results are combined into a score out of 9. 3. Regional networks are important.

SDGs. 4. Access to public information is a cornerstone of the 2030 Agenda. The annual UNESCO survey for monitoring indicator 16.10.2 has proven useful in offering countries a standardized approach for measuring and reporting on progress at the national level, including in their voluntary national reviews. Out of 125 participating countries and territories responding to the 2024 survey, 95 per cent (118) confirmed the existence of a legal guarantee for access to information as a fundamental right in their country. Survey results revealed ongoing regional efforts to improve ATI systems, particularly in public awareness campaigns, tracking of requests and appeals and institutional transparency and reporting. While more countries and territories are increasingly disclosing statistics on requests for information and how they are handled, the proportion of requests granted has remained relatively consistent with previous years (around 75 per cent). Countries must intensify their efforts to maintain accurate statistics, as meaningful progress can only be achieved through effective monitoring and evaluation.

Age influences the grounds — not just the frequency — of discrimination. The reasons people report being discriminated against shift markedly with age. Migration status, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation or gender identity are more often cited among younger respondents (aged 15-29 years). In contrast, among older adults (aged 60 years and older), discrimination is more commonly reported on grounds of age, and disability and health status. Persons with disabilities face persistently higher rates of discrimination. On average, almost 1 in three (28 per cent) of persons with disabilities report experiencing discrimination — compared with 17 per cent among persons without disabilities. Persons with disabilities face persistently higher rates of discrimination on every single ground tracked by the data, not only on the grounds of their disability status. This is a clear indication that grounds of discrimination do not exist in isolation. People with multiple, intersecting vulnerabilities often face compounded risks of discrimination.

Effective, accountable institutions Governments must commit to and invest in using data effectively to inform decision-making and adjust services at both national and local levels, based on evidence and real-time feedback. Governments should take steps to align public spending with national development plans, and ensure that financial management is transparent, equitable and responsive to the people. This includes enacting strong internal controls, independent external audits, and transparent procurement systems to ensure predictability and public confidence in institutions. Financial management plans should harness data to allow gender-responsive and inclusive budgeting and expenditure frameworks. Governments must commit to tracking and improving service delivery not just nationally but also at the Persons with disabilities consistently face higher rates of discrimination across all measured local level. Accountability mechanisms should be established that require institutions to regularly report on grounds service quality and user satisfaction. This may also require increased investments in funding, staffing, and service standards. Furthermore, better coordination across and within sectors is essential. Partnerships with the private sector and civil society can help make services more inclusive, efficient, and responsive to people’s needs. Digital technologies offer new opportunities to transform public service delivery, both in accessing public services and improving people’s overall experience with them. Governments should invest in accessible digital platforms and tools that can address service delivery gaps while ensuring equal access for all. Inclusive decision-making Representative institutions are more resilient and effective when they reflect the diversity of the societies they serve. Governments, parliaments and political parties should pursue bold reforms to increase the meaningful representation of women, youth, and Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities, and marginalized groups in leadership roles—across legislatures, public service, and the judiciary. This includes implementing quotas, inclusive recruitment and promotion practices, and removing structural, legal and cultural barriers to running for office. Civil service systems must emphasize merit-based recruitment, while also promoting diversity and inclusion. It is also essential to address workplace cultures and practices in order to challenge stereotypes. To support inclusive governance, authorities must invest in civic engagement platforms, transparency initiatives, and the systematic collection of disaggregated data to inform policy. These efforts should be anchored in legal frameworks and supported by partnerships with civil society and independent media to ensure that decision making is participatory and accountable.

Combined with standardized questionnaires, consistent outreach and a methodology tailored to the realities of parliamentary data, this approach allows for generally predictable updates and limits data gaps. Preventing discrimination Even so, data updating is not without its challenges for this indicator. Parliamentary compositions shift Tackling discrimination requires targeted policies, informed by solid and detailed data, and backed frequently owing to elections, appointments or resignations, and age data may be protected due to privacy by legal accountability. Governments must urgently adopt and enforce targeted anti-discrimination laws or simply unavailable, particularly in some regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. A high coverage policies informed by disaggregated data across race, gender, ethnicity, age, disability, migration status, threshold (typically 80 per cent) is required when reporting on MPs’ age data in order to avoid skewed and other grounds.

Challenges remain in compiling these indicators. Beyond data comparability between institutions in a country and how they compile and disseminate data on representation in public institutions and the Including refugees, IDPs and stateless persons in statistics to measure SDG 16 – both counting such judiciary, there is also the challenge of comparability across countries. Different countries often apply individuals and identifying their status to permit policy-relevant disaggregation – remains a major challenge, inconsistent practices when recording sex information of employees, which hinders comparability across but one that it is essential to tackle. If societies are to be inclusive, the data that underpin decision- time and countries. Additionally, the lack of adoption of harmonized definitions for \"decision-making making must also be inclusive and representative of the populations they are designed to reflect and to positions\" complicates data aggregation, particularly within diverse public service structures. Some serve. Forcibly displaced and stateless persons are often excluded from national data systems, making it countries do not use the International Standard Classification of Occupations of 2008, resulting in reduced challenging to design inclusive policies and deliver essential services. Integrating these populations into comparability91. Moreover, the production of disaggregated data remains uneven: some countries only national statistics, through censuses, surveys, and civil registration systems, is critical for ensuring their produce sex-disaggregated figures for either the lowest or the highest levels of decision-making, skewing needs are recognized and addressed. Disaggregated and accurate data not only support evidence-based the overall understanding of representation. policymaking but also help counter misinformation and promote social inclusion. Countries need to invest in better harnessing administrative data, as well as conducting surveys that Recent advances have been made, including through statistical recommendations and methodological are disaggregated by gender, age, ethnicity, disability, and other characteristics to allow for much more guidance issued by the UNSC-mandated Expert Group on Refugee, Internally Displaced Persons and accurate tracking of representation and inclusion in decision-making.

The FDS is a comprehensive survey programme designed to collect nationally such as “glass ceilings” and “glass walls” Countries should therefore expand data collection efforts to cover representative data on refugees and IDPs across multiple thematic areas, aligning with many SDG key sectors (e.g., health, education, law enforcement, infrastructure) and leadership levels, to better inform indicators including indicators 16.1.5 (perceptions of safety) and 16.9.1 (birth registration), and helping to targeted policy responses. monitor the inclusion of displaced populations in development efforts. By integrating these indicators, the FDS ensures that forcibly displaced people are represented in national and international statistics and Data coverage for indicator 16.9.1 (birth registration) has improved over time. This has largely been the global policy planning. integrating these indicators, the FDS ensures that forcibly displaced people are result of investment in data collection on birth registration in low- and middle-income countries through represented in national and international statistics and global policy planning. household surveys. This said, it is important to note that estimates obtained through surveys are highly sensitive to the way in which questions are formulated. This is especially true of questions about the civil authorities in charge of recording births, as survey respondents may not always be clear about who these authorities are. Similarly, questions about the possession of a birth certificate might also be misinterpreted, since respondents may confuse a birth certificate with a health or vaccination card or other document. For these reasons, the data on registration and possession of birth certificates obtained via caregiver reports need to be interpreted with a degree of caution. And even for those countries with mechanisms in place for registering births through civil registration systems, the systematic recording of births remains a serious challenge, highlighting the continuing urgent need to improve and strengthen civil registration and vital statistics. 88 Data are available for 40 countries for 16.7.1b and 16.7.1c. 89 Data are available for 11 countries for SDG 16.7.1b and 6 countries for 16.7.1c. 90 These statistics reflect the number of countries with at least one data point available in the period 2015-2025.

Shifting Course: Advancing SDG 16 to tackle the drivers of forced displacement At the end of 2024, 123.2 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced because of persecution, conflict, violence, human rights violations, and events seriously disturbing public order, 42.7 million of whom were refugees. SDG Indicator 10.7.4 identifies the proportion of a country’s population who become refugees93. Since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015 and over the last decade, the number of refugees has increased, reaching Shifting Course: Advancing SDG 16 to 450 refugees per 100,000 people by end of 2024. The majority of these refugees are fleeing war or conflict. tackle the drivers of forced displacement Forced displacement happens when peace, justice, and strong institutions break down. Advancing SDG Meaningful progress on SDG 16 is paramount to resolving the forced 16 is critical for effectively addressing the root causes and impacts of forced displacement. Without displacement challenge meaningful progress in this area, strategies to reduce and resolve displacement will remain fragmented, limiting their long-term effectiveness and sustainability. The frequency of conflicts, their widespread impact on people or areas, their duration and intensity are strong predictors of the number of people forced to flee each year. The data on SDG 16.1.2, which documents civilian deaths resulting from the world’s deadliest armed conflicts, as reported by the United Nations from 2015 to 2024, is strongly correlated with displacement outflows (new asylum seekers, refugees, and people in a refugee-like situation)94. A 1 per cent increase in civilian deaths is statistically associated with a 0.44 per cent increase in displacement outflows. As conflict-related civilian deaths have increased, more people are forced to flee (see Figure 52). When parties to the conflict do not abide strictly by their international humanitarian law and human rights obligations, and ensure the protection of civilians in their military operations, including by avoiding the use of explosive weapons in populated areas (EWIPA)95, the impact is devastating, including on the magnitude of displacement. Figure 53 shows that when the fighting becomes more indiscriminate –for example, when heavy weapons and explosives are used– the displacement outflow tends to increase. Furthermore, the effect lingers even when fighting has stopped, thereby hampering reconstruction efforts and creating barriers to return. 93 See the metadata of SDG Indicator 10.7.4. The indicator is computed as follows: [Number of refugees by country of origin at end- year / (End-year population in country of origin + number of refugees by country of origin at end-year)] * 100,000. For this report, refugees, people in a refugee-like situation and other people in need of international protection have been included. The indicator excludes Palestine refugees under UNRWA’s mandate. 94 This analysis employed a log-log regression using data on conflict (SDG 16.1.2), s trong institutions (SDG 16.a.1), ac counting for the size of the population, the gross domestic product per capita, food insecurity, civil liberty, and political rights as covariates. Additionally, the analysis also accounts for the year and the country as fixed effects. The analysis covers 15 conflicts in Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Ukraine, and Yemen from 2015 to 2024. For some countries, data on conflict-related deaths were not available for the entire period. There is a positive association between the indicator on conflict-related deaths and the number of newly displaced individuals (R-squared: 0.86; estimated coefficient:0.44; p-value < 2.2e-16).

United Nations Development Programme One United Nations Plaza New York, NY, 100017 USA www.undp.org Executive Summary Over the past ten years, UNDP has partnered with all 32 Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) to support the implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action, investing over USD 12.5 billion across areas such as governance, climate resilience, economic transformation, and financing for development. With a universal presence in LLDCs, UNDP translated global expertise into context-specific solutions through its country offices. Below is a synopsis of UNDP's policy and programmatic work aligned with national priorities. Governance Systems and Institutional Capacity: Effective governance is essential for 1 sustainable development in LLDCs, shaping inclusive service delivery, trust, and institutional resilience. UNDP addresses challenges such as democratic backsliding, digital transformation, and weak accountability through support for decentralization, capacity building, and participatory governance. In countries such as Nepal, Moldova, Lao PDR, and Mali, these efforts have strengthened institutions amid complex crises. Looking ahead, the Awaza Programme of Action and UNDP’s priorities in the coming years position governance as central to structural transformation, with a focus on digital infrastructure, inclusive economic governance, and local engagement. Regional Connectivity and Trade in LLDCs: Over the past decade, UNDP has supported 2 LLDCs in enhancing trade infrastructure, harmonizing cross-border procedures, and aligning national strategies with regional frameworks such as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Through the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) and Aid for Trade programmes, UNDP has delivered impactful support in countries like South Sudan, Lesotho, Bhutan, and across Central Asia — boosting MSME competitiveness, expanding access to digital and regional markets, and advancing inclusive trade policies. These efforts have improved institutional capacity, created jobs, strengthened value chains, and enabled women-led enterprises to access new trade opportunities. Looking ahead, UNDP will scale support for trade and transit reforms, digital trade, and sustainable value chain integration, aligned with the Awaza Programme of Action and UNDP’s priorities. Local Economic Development and MSMEs in LLDCs: MSMEs are the backbone of LLDC 3 economies, yet face persistent barriers to finance, markets, and technology — challenges compounded for women, youth, and informal workers. UNDP has supported all LLDCs in strengthening inclusive local economies by enhancing MSME productivity, market access, digital inclusion, and value chain development. Through initiatives like the SDG Value Chains Programme, Aid for Trade, and national platforms such as Malawi’s Innovation Challenge Fund and Botswana’s Supplier Development Programme, UNDP has expanded financing, created jobs, empowered women entrepreneurs, and built resilience in sectors from agriculture to e-commerce. Looking ahead, UNDP will continue advancing inclusive, digitally enabled, and gender-responsive MSME ecosystems to drive equitable growth and local development across LLDCs. 1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Climate Resilience and Energy Transitions in LLDCs: Landlocked Developing Countries face 4 critical energy access gaps and heightened vulnerability to climate impacts, with over 215 million people lacking reliable electricity and rural access far below global averages. UNDP has supported 31 LLDCs through its Climate Promise initiative, helping countries enhance their climate commitments, mobilize finance, and integrate mitigation and adaptation strategies. Flagship programmes like the Africa Minigrids Program and targeted support in countries such as Paraguay have advanced clean energy access, e-mobility, and nature-based solutions. Through policy, technical, and financial assistance, UNDP is helping LLDCs diversify energy sources, close access gaps, and build climate-resilient, low-carbon economies, aligned with the Awaza Programme of Action. Natural Resource Management in LLDCs: Landlocked Developing Countries face acute 5 environmental pressures, ranging from land degradation and water scarcity to climate shocks, due to their heavy reliance on agriculture, mining, and forestry, especially in fragile ecosystems. Approximately 54% of LLDCs’ land consists of drylands, home to 60% of their populations, making these countries particularly vulnerable to climate change and environmental degradation. UNDP supports LLDCs in restoring landscapes, improving resource governance, and promoting nature-based solutions through its Nature Pledge and partnerships with the GEF and GCF. From dryland restoration in Niger and Chad to climate-smart agriculture in Burkina Faso and forest management in Bhutan and Bolivia, UNDP helps countries integrate environmental priorities into national strategies while supporting local communities. Looking ahead, UNDP will expand efforts in land restoration, inclusive governance, and green finance to help LLDCs transform natural resource vulnerabilities into pathways for resilience and sustainable development. Harnessing Extractives for Sustainable Development in LLDCs: Extractive industries, 6 especially critical and development minerals, are central to the economies of many LLDCs, driving exports, jobs, and public revenues. As global demand for transition minerals rises, UNDP supports LLDCs in ensuring resource governance delivers inclusive and sustainable development. Through policy support, partnerships, and initiatives like the ACP-EU Development Minerals Programme, UNDP has helped countries such as Burkina Faso, Zambia, and Mongolia advance local value addition, environmental safeguards, and community benefits, including artisanal and small-scale mining formalization. Aligned with the UN Secretary-General’s Panel on Critical Minerals and the Awaza Programme of Action, UNDP is scaling up its support for responsible mining, regional cooperation, and economic diversification to help LLDCs move up the value chain and benefit more equitably from the global energy transition. Access to Services in LLDCs: Persistent barriers ranging from fiscal constraints to geographic 7 isolation continue to limit access to essential services like health, education, and social protection in LLDCs. UNDP helps countries overcome these barriers by strengthening public systems and leveraging digital innovations to improve service delivery. In Zimbabwe, UNDP’s long-standing partnership with the Global Fund contributed to a major turnaround in the HIV response, while in Kazakhstan, the Digital Family Card now connects millions to social benefits. Recognizing that service access underpins human resilience and inclusive development, UNDP’ prioritizes modernizing systems, expanding digital infrastructure, and supporting universal access to basic services especially for women, youth, and vulnerable communities in remote areas. 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Investing in Human Capital and Skills in LLDCs: Building strong human capital is vital for 8 LLDCs to overcome structural constraints and foster inclusive, resilient economies. With average HDI and education outcomes lagging behind global levels, UNDP works across LLDCs to expand access to quality education, strengthen vocational training, and improve livelihoods—especially for youth, women, and marginalized groups. From digital and green skills development in Azerbaijan to entrepreneurship training in South Sudan and TVET modernization in Bhutan, UNDP promotes skills that align with evolving labour markets. UNDP will intensify investments in human capital to support job-rich economic diversification, expand digital learning, and help LLDCs unlock the full potential of their people for long-term development. Driving Digital Transformation in LLDCs: LLDCs face deep digital divides, with only 27% of 9 their populations using the internet, compared to 90% in developed countries. UNDP is supporting digital inclusion by expanding infrastructure, building skills, and designing inclusive digital services. From smart health systems in Malawi to digital social protection in Kazakhstan and AI strategies in Mongolia, UNDP helps LLDCs harness digital technologies for better governance, service delivery, and economic opportunity. In South Sudan, digitizing community lending platforms reduced interest rates and expanded financial access for border communities. Looking ahead, UNDP will deepen its support to LLDCs in scaling connectivity, building digital public infrastructure, and shaping responsible AI use, ensuring digital transformation accelerates not undermines, but boosts inclusive development. Financing Sustainable Development in LLDCs: Since the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, 10 financing for development has evolved rapidly, yet LLDCs still face persistent challenges—aid dependence, rising debt risks, and limited private capital access. Over a third are in or near debt distress, and FDI remains low and narrowly focused. UNDP has played a catalytic role in strengthening financial governance, diversifying finance, and aligning public and private investments with development goals. In 23 LLDCs, it has supported Integrated National Financing Frameworks, advanced gender-responsive and climate finance, and promoted inclusive public-private dialogue. These efforts are enhancing fiscal resilience and inclusion. UNDP will continue helping LLDCs build sustainable, forward-looking financing systems to drive long-term development. Sustainable LDC Graduation of LLDCs: Sixteen of the world’s 32 LLDCs are also classified as 11 Least Developed Countries (LDCs), facing compounded vulnerabilities from geographic isolation, structural economic weaknesses, and exposure to external shocks. Graduation from LDC status remains challenging, with only Bhutan having successfully graduated as an LLDC (since Botswana in 1994). UNDP supports LLDC-LDCs countries through tailored policy advice, capacity building, and smooth transition strategies to help safeguard development gains post-graduation. In Bhutan and Nepal, UNDP has strengthened national planning, decentralization, and institutional resilience to support inclusive transitions. Aligned with the Awaza and Doha Programmes of Action, UNDP will continue to support LLDC-LDCs in advancing sustainable graduation pathways by linking national policies with global frameworks and building long-term resilience against shocks. 3 INTRODUCTION UNDP’s Strategic Engagement with Landlocked Developing Countries: A Decade of Impact and a Committment for the Future The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been a steadfast partner through the years to Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), supporting their efforts to overcome structural challenges and achieve sustainable development under the framework of the Vienna Programme of Action (VPoA) 2014–2024. Over the past decade, UNDP has worked closely with all 32 LLDCs to advance progress across the six priority areas of the VPoA, leveraging its technical expertise, expansive network of country offices, and ability to mobilize financial resources to promote inclusive, resilient, and sustainable development. UNDP’s country offices serve as the operational backbone of UNDP's support, ensuring that global knowledge, financing, and technical expertise are translated into context-specific, nationally owned solutions. Country offices in nations such as Zambia, Nepal, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia, Bolivia, and Armenia, among others, have played pivotal roles in supporting national development plans, implementing climate and governance programmes, and helping governments access and manage international financing instruments. UNDP's in-country presence enables it to provide agile, responsive, and sustained support across diverse development and crisis contexts. LLDCs face deep structural constraints due to their geographical location, with no direct access to seaports, leading to high transport costs, logistical inefficiencies, and reduced trade competitiveness. These countries represent about 7% of the global population yet account for only 1.1% of global merchandise exports. Their economies remain vulnerable to external shocks, heavily dependent on primary commodities, and marked by low levels of industrialization and economic diversification. The COVID-19 pandemic, climate-induced disasters, and rising debt burdens have further exacerbated these vulnerabilities. Several LLDCs are now classified as being in or at high risk of debt distress. At the same time, Official Development Assistance (ODA) remains both insufficient and unevenly distributed — with five LLDCs receiving nearly half of all ODA disbursed to the group between 2014 and 2023. Against this backdrop, UNDP has delivered targeted support across key areas, including strengthening governance, climate resilience, economic transformation, financing for development, regional connectivity and trade, MSMEs, health and social protection, human capital and skills development, and digital transformation. At the country level, this includes strengthening decentralized governance in Moldova and Nepal, advancing electoral and constitutional reform in Mali, and supporting disaster risk reduction and justice sector reform across the Sahel. Through global initiatives like the Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs), UNDP has supported 23 LLDCs to align public and private resources with SDG priorities, improving fiscal governance, investment frameworks, and policy coherence. As LLDCs transition to the next phase of their development journey under the Programme of Action for LLDCs for the Decade 2024–2034, UNDP remains committed to deepening its engagement. The new 4 INTRODUCTON agenda calls for action across five key pillars: transformative economic diversification and structural change, enhanced regional connectivity and trade, improved governance and institutional capacities, resilience to climate and external shocks, and sustainable financing. These priorities are closely aligned with UNDP’s, which focuses on integrated development solutions to promote human development and achieve prosperity for all within the planetary boundaries. FIGURE 1 AWAZA Programme of Action (2024 - 2034) Key Priorities Structural Transformation and Science, Technology, and Innovation 1 Accelerating inclusive and sustainable economic diversification in LLDCs through industrialization, digitalization, innovation, and technological upgrading.

Means of Implementation 5 Mobilizing adequate, predictable, and sustainable financing, partnerships, capacity-building, and data systems to support implementation of the Awaza Programme of Action. Looking ahead, UNDP will strengthen its role as a trusted partner by scaling investments in catalytic areas such as: ▪ Investing in inclusive and effective governance to foster civic trust, peace, and institutional resilience; ▪ Promoting economic transformation and digitalization to unlock productivity, trade opportunities and inclusive value chains; ▪ Supporting climate adaptation, energy transition, and natural resource management, while leveraging nature-positive solutions, especially in high-risk areas; ▪ Capitalizing on the demographic youth dividend by investing in human capital development and skills for today and tomorrow; and ▪ Boosting financing for development, including through public and private blended finance solutions. With over a decade of partnership, evidence-based programming, and deep presence in 31 out of the 32 LLDCs, UNDP is well positioned to help these countries turn structural constraints into drivers of sustainable and inclusive development. The coming decade is an opportunity to accelerate progress, strengthen resilience, and ensure that LLDCs are not only included but empowered within the global development architecture. 5 7 INTRODUCTION UNDP’s technical expertise and financial resources have played a critical role in advancing sustainable development in LLDC In the past decade, UNDP invested over USD 12.5 billion across the 32 programmatic countries. In the earlier part of this timeframe, the Asia-Pacific region saw a high concentration of UNDP investments in LLDCs, largely due to significant funding directed to Afghanistan. Afghanistan's unique challenges — stemming from ongoing conflict, socio-economic instability, and complex humanitarian needs — required substantial UNDP support, which led to an overall Asia-Pacific investment figure of approximately USD 4.76 billion over the decade (Fig. 2). This figure, while reflecting a broad regional focus, was heavily influenced by Afghanistan's substantial needs rather than a uniformly distributed investment across the LLDCs in the region. As the decade progressed, African LLDCs emerged as the primary recipients of LLDC funding, receiving approximately USD 5.97 billion by the end of 2023. This reorientation not only reflects UNDP’s adaptive strategy to align resources with evolving regional needs but also acknowledges the larger population share in African LLDCs, where nearly 57% of the total LLDC population resides. Persistent structural challenges in these countries such as infrastructure deficits, trade barriers, and climate vulnerabilities require intensified support.

Meanwhile, Europe and the CIS received a cumulative investment of USD 1.55 billion, and Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) received USD 382.2 million, indicating a steady but more moderate level of support in these regions, aimed at addressing their specific, though comparatively less acute, developmental challenges. The funding distribution during the decade reveals a diverse and multi-layered support system. The largest share, USD 4.75 billion, came from bilateral donors, emphasizing the crucial role of individual countries (Fig. 3) in backing UNDP’s efforts in LLDCs. Vertical funds contributed the second-largest share at USD 3.64 billion, indicating targeted investments that address thematic priorities such as climate resilience and health. UNDP’s own resources amounted to USD 1.36 billion, underscoring its commitment to these countries' development needs alongside external funding. Programme countries themselves contributed USD 816 million, showing a trend toward domestic co-financing, which enhances the ownership and sustainability of development initiatives. The European Union, UN agencies, Multi-Partner Trust Funds (MPTFs), Joint Programmes, and other sources collectively contributed over USD 1.3 billion, showcasing strong partnerships and collaboration within the UN system to support sustainable development in LLDCs. Together, this blend of funding sources enabled UNDP to pursue both targeted and holistic approaches to address the unique challenges faced by LLDCs. UNDP has allocated, on average, 34% of its regular resources to LLDCs over the past decade. Within this allocation, African LLDCs have received the majority share, accounting for 76.6% of the regular resources directed to these countries (Fig. 4). LLDCs in Asia have received 15.5%, while those in Europe and the CIS have received 5.5%. LAC LLDCs received the smallest portion, with just 1% of the allocated resources. This distribution underscores UNDP’s focus on African LLDCs, recognizing the persistent and significant development challenges they face compared to LLDCs in other regions.

An overwhelming majority of these funds, approximately USD 2.96 billion, come from the GFATM, underscoring the emphasis on health interventions in LLDCs. The GEF is the next largest contributor with USD 546 million, followed by the GCF at USD 100 million. Together, these vertical funds are structured to address critical areas such as health crises, environmental protection, and climate resilience, thereby supporting sustainable development in these high-need contexts. As depicted in the funding distribution (Fig. 5), Zimbabwe is the largest recipient of vertical fund investments among LLDCs, receiving a substantial share primarily from GFATM. This high allocation reflects the country's significant health challenges and the need for intensive support to combat diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Following Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Sudan, Chad, and Burundi also received notable funding, with these countries similarly facing health, environmental, and climate-related challenges that vertical funds are structured to address. Beyond health-related funds, the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and the Global Climate Fund (GCF) have also played critical roles in supporting LLDCs. These funds are primarily directed toward countries facing acute environmental and climate vulnerabilities, ensuring that resources are allocated to mitigate climate risks, protect biodiversity, and promote sustainable development. The distribution of funds across these major recipients illustrates how vertical funds enable focused interventions, supporting countries with the greatest needs within thematic areas of health and environmental sustainability. This targeted approach helps address specific development gaps while complementing broader investments in LLDCs.

When governance systems are inclusive, transparent, and accountable, they foster trust between people and institutions, promote stability, and enable equitable access to opportunities. Conversely, weak or exclusionary governance undermines social cohesion, deepens inequality, and increases the risk of conflict or instability. Today, several major trends are reshaping the governance landscape. First, democratic backsliding and shrinking civic space have emerged as pressing concerns in many contexts, with rising restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and association. These dynamics limit citizen participation, weaken institutional legitimacy, and threaten social contracts essential for peace and development. Second, rapid digital transformation is redefining how governance operates, offering opportunities to improve service delivery and transparency, but also posing challenges related to equity, privacy, and institutional capacity. Harnessing digital tools effectively requires modernizing governance frameworks to ensure technology benefits all segments of society and reinforces, rather than undermines, accountability and inclusion. Third, persistent corruption and weak integrity systems remain significant barriers to effective governance, diverting resources from development priorities and eroding public confidence. Strengthening anti-corruption mechanisms and fostering a culture of integrity are critical to building resilient institutions and advancing the SDGs. Finally, integrated, multi-level governance approaches are increasingly vital, as complex global challenges like climate change, pandemics, and economic shocks demand coherent responses that engage actors across local, national, and international levels. Ensuring governance systems are responsive, inclusive, and adaptable is essential for societies to navigate uncertainty and build shared prosperity. UNDP’s governance-related work in LLDCs is grounded in a comprehensive approach that seeks to strengthen local and national institutions, promote inclusive and accountable governance, and accelerate progress toward sustainable development. Recognizing the diversity of local contexts, UNDP supports a wide range of interventions including capacity building for elected representatives, public officials and civil servants, policy formulation, and institutional development. These efforts aim to enhance democratic participation and representation, improve public service delivery, and foster transparency, accountability, and human rights at all levels of government. UNDP’s support for decentralization and local governance reforms is particularly prominent, aiming to empower subnational governments to manage the opportunities and responsibilities arising from devolution, and to ensure governance systems are responsive to the needs of marginalized and vulnerable populations. This work is closely linked to broader development objectives, such as building resilience to crises, fostering inclusive economic development, promoting gender equality, and advancing environmental sustainability, and is carried out in partnership with national stakeholders and the international community. 10 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 1 Over the past decade, UNDP’s governance interventions in LLDCs have prioritized strengthening legal and institutional frameworks for decentralization; building the capacity of local governments for participatory planning, budgeting, and service delivery; enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusive participation in local governance; and mainstreaming cross-cutting issues – such as gender equality, health (including HIV/AIDS) and social inclusion – into local planning processes. In Nepal, UNDP supported the strengthening of the planning and monitoring capacity of the National Planning Commission and the implementation of participatory district development and local governance programmes. These interventions contributed to decentralization by empowering local governments to plan, implement, and monitor development activities, and by promoting inclusive participation in local governance structures. In Moldova, the Decentralization Strategy laid the groundwork for a decade of reforms aimed at consolidating local governance. UNDP supported the implementation of this strategy by promoting greater transparency, accountability, and efficiency in both central and local public authorities. This support included capacity development for local officials, facilitation of participatory planning, and strengthening of administrative governance. In Lao PDR, UNDP’s support involved advocacy for decentralization, piloting projects to demonstrate the benefits of local participation, and building the capacity of local officials in planning and programme development. These interventions were essential in contexts where local officials were unfamiliar with basic governance concepts such as action planning and annual programming. The focus was on demonstrating that local participation is both feasible and beneficial for advancing human development. In Burkina Faso, UNDP supports decentralization and local development across 10 of the country’s 13 regions and 114 out of 350 municipalities. These efforts benefit over 10 million people by improving living conditions, expanding access to services (such as civil registration and healthcare) and strengthening transparency and accountability in local governance and planning processes. In Chad, from the outset to the conclusion of the transition process, UNDP played a pivotal role in supporting the return to constitutional order through the establishment and management of a basket fund dedicated to the transition. This support included embedded electoral technical assistance and surge capacity to key electoral institutions, such as the National Agency for the Management of Elections (ANGE) and the Constitutional Council. UNDP also procured electoral materials to enhance the credibility and inclusiveness of the process, and supported civic awareness and women’s empowerment through grants to CSOs and national campaigns. For the first time, election materials were pre-positioned two weeks ahead of voting. Women’s participation exceeded government quotas, and election costs were reduced by over 20%. Despite these advances, concerns remain around the transparency of the process. In Ethiopia, UNDP’s SEEDS 2 Project (2023–2027) builds on the success of SEEDS 1 to strengthen electoral systems and promote inclusive, transparent, and accountable democratic processes. It supports the National Elections Board of Ethiopia by enhancing institutional capacity, promoting inclusive participation, and improving the legal and information environment for credible elections. 11 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 1 In Mali, the PROSMED programme and the Sahel Resilience Project have contributed to improved access to justice, conflict prevention, and basic services across 22 districts1. Since 2021, PROSMED has trained nearly 2,800 formal and informal actors—including women and youth—on women’s rights and conflict management, revitalized over 320 land commissions, and resolved 239 local conflicts². It also piloted legal assistance in Mopti, supported gender-based violence cases, and aided the development of a national anti-corruption strategy³. In parallel, the programme implemented over 60 community initiatives to prevent violent extremism, including training for religious leaders and students in six central-southern districts⁴. In Armenia, the “Modern Parliament for a Modern Armenia” (MAP) project, implemented by UNDP Armenia in its first phase (2019–2023), significantly contributed to strengthening the National Assembly’s institutional capacities, transparency, and public engagement. It supported the development of e-parliament tools, modernized legislative procedures, and enhanced the skills of parliamentary staff and committees. Building on these results, MAP 2.0 (2023–2026) aims to deepen reforms by advancing digital transformation, promoting gender equality and youth engagement, and strengthening the parliament’s responsiveness, oversight, and connection with citizens. LOOKING AHEAD The Awaza Programme of Action places governance as a central element of its vision for sustainable and resilient development in LLDCs. It recognizes effective, transparent, and accountable institutions as foundational for achieving structural transformation, fostering inclusive growth, and enhancing social cohesion. It emphasizes that strong governance is not only essential for facilitating trade and investment but also for upholding human rights, reducing inequality, and building trust between governments and citizens. By framing governance as a central pillar rather than a peripheral enabler, it marks a clear evolution in the LLDC development agenda. UNDP’s strategic priorities place effective governance at the very core of its ambition to support countries in navigating complex, interconnected challenges. Governance is framed not merely as a technical domain but as a foundational enabler of systemic change, echoing Awaza’s call for accountable and resilient institutions to underpin sustainable development in LLDCs. UNDP commits to supporting public institutions at both national and local levels to enhance service delivery, foster social cohesion, and improve resilience to shocks. Recognizing the growing importance of digital transformation, UNDP will expand support for digital public infrastructure, helping countries build more responsive, transparent, and citizen-centered governance systems, with special emphasis on using AI and data to improve public services and policymaking. More importantly, governance is strategically placed within a systems approach, integrating it across prosperity, environmental sustainability, and crisis resilience objectives — ensuring governance reforms are not siloed but contribute to broader transformations sought by Awaza and other Programmes of Actions. UNDP will intensify its work on economic governance to make public finance more equitable and accountable, catalyze anti-corruption efforts, and strengthen public-private partnerships. Furthermore, UNDP’s investments in local governance, conflict analysis, community security, and participatory processes will help LLDCs address root causes of instability, complementing Awaza’s emphasis on governance as a tool for resilience in the face of crises. 12 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 2 Facilitating Regional Connectivity and Trade for LLDCs LLDCs disproportionately face high trade costs due to inadequate infrastructure and their lack of direct access to seaports. For instance, the average distance of a landlocked country to a seaport is 1,370 kilometres, delaying the movement of goods and services and causing higher transportation costs5. Given these challenges, regional integration and trade facilitation serve as critical pathways to increased economic resilience and competitiveness, inclusive growth, and sustainable development across LLDCs. For LLDCs, reaching international markets depend not only on their own policies and infrastructure but also on those of neighboring countries, making regional integration, including the harmonization of investment frameworks essential for improving transit transport connectivity and expanding regional markets.⁶ From 2014 to 2023, LLDCs concluded at least 100 new international investment agreements (IIAs), including 71 bilateral investment treaties and 29 treaties with investment provisions, with at least 58 of these new IIAs entering into force during this period.⁷ At least 14 IIAs were concluded between LLDCs or between LLDCs and neighboring countries.⁸ This points to a broader trend of growing regionalization as LLDCs seek a strategic balance between global trade integration and regional economic resilience, marking a significant advancement in regional cooperation among LLDCs and other developing countries. UNDP supports LLDCs in strengthening their participation in regional trade and investment frameworks by providing technical assistance, policy development and planning, and capacity-building to improve trade facilitation, reduce non-tariff barriers, and harmonize cross-border procedures. Through initiatives such as the Aid for Trade Programme and targeted support for the implementation of the AfCFTA, UNDP has helped LLDCs align national strategies with regional commitments, enhance institutional coordination, and improve infrastructure planning. This support has contributed to increased intra-regional trade, and expanded market access for SMEs, laying the groundwork for more inclusive and sustainable economic development among LLDCs and their regional trade partners. ENHANCED INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (EIF) The EIF is the only multilateral partnership dedicated to assisting LDCs in leveraging trade as an engine for growth, sustainable development and poverty reduction.⁹ First established in 1997 and having completed its second phase (2015 - 2024).10 EIF consists of 51 countries, 26 donors, and eight partner agencies working closely with governments, development organizations, and civil society.11 Since its inception, EIF has invested more than USD 22012 million in trade-for-development initiatives with partner countries, generating more than USD 1 billion in exports, and extending support to 37 countries to integrate trade into their national development plans.13 61% of EIF productive capacity beneficiaries are women.14 13 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 2 UNDP has played a key role in supporting the EIF partnership in providing technical support in formulating and implementing trade policies, and strengthening trade-related institutions, across several LLDCs, including Bhutan, Central African Republic, Chad, Lesotho, South Sudan and Uganda, while also supporting capacity assessments in Burkina Faso and Malawi. In South Sudan, which became the world’s youngest nation after its secession from Sudan in 2011, UNDP’s support under the EIF has been pivotal in strengthening trade institutions and promoting inclusive, trade-led development in a post-conflict setting. UNDP supported the country’s first EIF Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) and its 2022 update, integration of trade into national development strategies, and capacity building on economic diplomacy and regional trade.15 The partnership also led to the launch of South Sudan’s first e-commerce platform, Dukaanye, and a dedicated e-commerce hub to support MSMEs, particularly women-led enterprises. Support extended to WTO accession efforts, AfCFTA engagement, and market access initiatives in the shea butter value chain.16 In Lesotho, the UNDP-EIF partnership has significantly strengthened agricultural value chains and trade capacity, particularly in the horticulture sector. Working with the International Trade Centre, the partnership supported the development of the 2021–2025 National Trade Strategy and helped boost MSME exports in key sectors. Through greenhouse installations, pest surveillance, and provision of hybrid seeds, vegetable production among supported farmers increased by 20%, and over 650 horticulture jobs were created.17 More than 100 smallholder greenhouse operators were trained in business management and traceability, improving formal market access.18 The programme also enhanced Lesotho’s engagement in AfCFTA negotiations, sensitized over 120 MSMEs across 3 districts on export procedures, and expanded training and capacity building for journalists on trade policies.19 In Bhutan, the UNDP-EIF partnership has played a significant role in advancing inclusive trade development aligned with the country’s unique Gross National Happiness (GNH) approach and its successful graduation from LDC status in 2023. Since 2009, EIF has supported institutional capacity-building, trade policy formulation, and human resource development through the National Implementation Unit (NIU), enabling effective inter-ministerial coordination and Aid for Trade (AfT) implementation. Bhutan’s National Export Strategy (2022), developed with support from UNDP through the EIF, serves as a roadmap for boosting export growth by identifying key constraints and proposing reforms to address institutional, legal, and infrastructure gaps, improve standards and certification, strengthen productive capacities, and enhance export promotion. Other key achievements include the development of e-governance platforms, e-commerce policy guidelines, and an e-regulation portal, which has attracted over USD 14.5 million in FDI and USD 350 million of domestic investment projects since its launch in 2020.20 With support from the EIF, in 2017, Bhutan launched an online auction system for potatoes, among the nation’s main exports, to improve price transparency and reduce transaction costs21, enabling over 3,000 farmers (61% of them women) to access market information, increase profits, and reduce processing time, with the initiative later expanded to other commodities like cardamom. The “Made in Bhutan” branding initiative and Seal of Excellence have enhanced export visibility and MSME participation in international markets and trade fairs. The partnership has also supported the Bhutan Association of Women Enterprises, with over 4,000 members, by providing training on microfinance and financial literacy, along with fostering financial inclusion by installing portable ATMs across districts where communities have no access to banks.22 14 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 2 AID FOR TRADE IN CENTRAL ASIA UNDP’s Aid for Trade in Central Asia programme focuses on supporting LLDCs in Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) in pursuing inclusive and sustainable economic development by increasing private sector and MSME competitiveness, advancing economic diversification and resilience, supporting regional trade cooperation, connectivity, and integration, and enhancing value addition and promoting green value chains.23 In particular, the programme addresses the challenges of LLDCs in Central Asia in transitioning from commodity-dependent growth to more inclusive and sustainable development by diversifying their economies, expanding private sector productive capacities, fomenting regional trade integration, accessing new markets, and strengthening job creation across sectors such as agriculture, food processing, and tourism, with a strong focus on gender equality and environmental sustainability.24 Implemented since 2009 and currently in its fifth phase (2022 - 2025), the programme has supported the development of inclusive trade development policies and support services, while strengthening the economic competitiveness of MSMEs, especially during crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), enhancing firm-level efficiencies and productive capacities, increased value addition, and the development of green, employment-rich, and resilient value chains.25 In Kyrgyzstan, efforts focused on strengthening the legal framework for trade, improving digital export platforms, and promoting market access for MSMEs, particularly in key sectors like tourism and e-commerce.26 In Uzbekistan, the project worked closely with national partners to refine trade regulations, enhance investment policies, and support women-led enterprises through mentorship and business development initiatives.27 In Tajikistan, emphasis was placed on assessing and removing regulatory barriers for trade, developing an Export Promotion Law, and modernizing trade support services to improve market access.28 At the regional level, the initiative supported the harmonization of quality standards and improved international market access for key agricultural exports, organization of regional workshops and capacity building on Free-Trade Agreements negotiations, and training over 250 trade and export marketing specialists, MSME exporters, and trade support professionals in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan on identifying new export opportunities.29 LOOKING AHEAD The Awaza Programme of Action prioritizes trade, trade facilitation, and regional integration as critical levers for sustainable development in LLDCs, emphasizing the need to simplify customs procedures, reduce non-tariff barriers, enhance transit connectivity and infrastructure, develop transport corridors, and promote digital trade. Aligned with these priorities, UNDP will reinvigorate and scale up its strategic partnerships with UNCTAD, UNIDO, and other development partners to deliver targeted support that enhances LLDCs’ trade competitiveness and connectivity. This includes deepening trade capacity-building, supporting transit and infrastructure reforms, and fostering inclusive participation in regional and global value chains. In line with its strategic priorities, UNDP will also connect trade facilitation to sustainable value chain development, local economic development, and MSME empowerment, supporting LLDCs in realizing more diversified, inclusive, and resilient economies. 15 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 3 Unlocking Local Economic Development: Support to MSMEs in LLDCs Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) account for about 90% of businesses and more than 50% of employment worldwide.30 In developing countries, including LLDCs, this share is even higher after accounting for the informal sector.31 Across LLDCs, MSMEs play a critical role in enabling local economic development and inclusive growth, employment creation and income generation, enhancement of trade and value chain beneficiation, and poverty alleviation.32 Approximately 60% of the population in LLDCs is under 25, representing a large source of potential and innovation.33 Yet, youth in LLDCs face high unemployment, inadequate educational and training opportunities in STEM fields, and lack affordable ICT access34, and many are self-employed or employed in the informal sector.35 Despite representing the vast majority of firms in LLDCs, MSMEs frequently encounter significant barriers, such as limited access to finance (characterized by high interest rates, excessive collateral requirements, and underdeveloped financial systems), infrastructure deficits, regulatory and bureaucratic hurdles, and difficulty accessing trade finance and formal markets.36 In addition, MSMEs often struggle with low productivity, poor working conditions and high vulnerability to economic, political and environmental shocks. Women, young workers and entrepreneurs operating in the informal economy are particularly vulnerable, and face additional constraints.37 Enabling access to reliable financing instruments and digital technologies can play a vital role in supporting MSMEs to overcome structural challenges and serve as engines for inclusive growth, job creation, and poverty reduction in LLDCs. Enhancing MSME access to digital technologies can increase transparency of markets, enabling buyers and sellers to interact and trade securely, Improve and formalize trade networks, provide access to reliable and cost-effective online payment platforms, simplify cross-border logistics and customs procedures (especially for small businesses), and unlock alternative financing options through fintech innovations such as crowdfunding and AI-powered financial tools, ultimately advancing financial inclusion and competitiveness for MSMEs in LLDCs.38 UNDP provides support to over 100 countries39, including all LLDCs, in unlocking the full potential of MSMEs to drive inclusive, human-centred, and resilient growth by fostering an enabling environment for expanding market access, enhancing productivity, advancing entrepreneurship and innovation, and promoting jobs, livelihoods, and decent work. This includes several projects that support agricultural capacities, trade and exports, and economic resilience, with the production, development, and transformation of value chains, directly contributing to men and women’s livelihoods.40 In Mali, UNDP has supported women-led mango cooperatives, which equipped women farmers the right skills to grow and treat their produce for export. The programme helped lead to a nearly fourfold increase in Mali's mango exports.41 UNDP’s SDG Value Chains Programme provides countries with technical assistance and innovative methodologies to support the development of inclusive value chains, including MSMEs, enhancing their integration into regional, national, and international supply chains. Using a market-driven approach, the programme enhances the local capacities of MSMEs to overcome structural barriers, such as access to finance, investments in digitalization and innovation, regulatory burdens, and broader challenges in the 16 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 3 enabling environment, with a strong focus on social norm transformation, gender equality, and women’s economic empowerment. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the initiative focused on strengthening the economic resilience of SMEs, enabling them to serve as critical sources of employment and economic prosperity across communities42, while becoming a strong driver of sustained economic recovery and relief strategies. The SDG Value Chains Programme began in Mexico in 2008 with the Supplier Development Methodology (SDP). Globally, the SDG Value Chains Programme now operates across 16 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia,43 including LLDCs such as Botswana and Paraguay. In Paraguay, the programme has demonstrated transformative impact through the En Marcha pilot in Concepción in 2024, which strengthened core business management capacities of MSMEs, more than half were women-led, leading to an increase in average monthly sales, improved profitability, and advanced gender-responsive business strategies.44 In Botswana, the SDP strengthened the resilience of women and youth-owned MSMEs during the COVID-19 crisis by strengthening their productive capacity and connecting them to large national buyers in key sectors like agriculture, health, and technology.45 Through close mentorship, access to finance, and strategic partnerships — including with First National Bank Botswana, the SDP empowered SMEs to improve quality, increase revenues, and build long-term resilience in a challenging, resource-dependent economy. Through a partnership with the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Culture and the Botswana Innovation Hub, UNDP is rolling out the #YouthConnekt platform to support youth entrepreneurs with tailored training and mentorship, while reaching young people through digital engagement, market linkages, and access to finance and networks.46 Launched in 2014 under UNDP Malawi’s Private Sector Development programme, the Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund (MICF) has mobilized catalytic grant financing and technical assistance to support economic diversification, job creation and income generation, enhanced productivity, and innovation across the private sector and MSMEs, especially to increase the inclusiveness and competitiveness of value chains in crucial sectors, such as agriculture, manufacturing,47 and tourism.48 The programme accepts applications from MSMEs, small businesses, and the private sector in Malawi and matches their funding to scale inclusive business models. As of 2022, over 9 thematic rounds were launched, with USD 32 million of investments in the programme, and 56 MSMEs and private sector companies contracted to develop inclusive business models, while supporting livelihoods and income generation opportunities for nearly 600,000 individuals across more than 55,000 households, and securing permanent employment for more than 2,400 unskilled and low-income workers.49 Over 7,200 MSMEs have accessed loans and improved financial services through the disbursement of MK 2.3 billion of SME loans through MICF.50 Through innovation, MICF projects have launched new or enhanced products that have brought access to basic services for low-income consumers.51 Over 40% of MICF’s beneficiaries are women, and 27% of MICF projects are led by female owners and managers of MSMEs and businesses in Malawi’s private sector.52 COUNTRY EXAMPLE: AFGHANISTAN UNDP’s integrated support has provided a lifeline to 8 million women across Afghanistan, extending access to basic services and infrastructure, creating jobs, supporting MSMEs) strengthening community resilience against hazards and climate risks, expanding access to renewable energy, and providing livelihood support to farmers. In addition to fostering social cohesion and solidarity in the workplace, UNDP’s integrated approach also includes the development of digital skills, to empower women to overcome mobility restrictions and effectively market their products. The provision of solar power to MSMEs employing women, reduces reliance on expensive, polluting generators, reducing emissions and cutting operational costs.53 17 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 3 The resulting savings are then reinvested to expand capacity and create more employment for women. For example, in 2024, a seed investment of US $4 million from UNDP’s core resources unlocked over US $34 million of non-core funding to advance women’s socio-economic empowerment in Afghanistan. These investments supported almost 80,000 female-led MSMEs nationwide, and have generated nearly 400,000 jobs, mostly for women, and have indirectly benefited over 2.7 million Afghan citizens. Despite harsh restrictions, community savings and loan groups have further supported over 27,000 women in starting and expanding their businesses, enhancing the economic resilience of their communities.54 By expanding access to financial inclusion, women have also contributed to their families, creating a chain of prosperity that revitalizes communities and can potentially improve the lives of generations to come. A preliminary assessment of the programme, in 2024, provides evidence of positive impact, with an overall boost in production and a 100 percent increase in income for surveyed women, who benefited from the integrated interventions.55 Since 2022, UNDP’s partnership with the European Union has fostered inclusive economic recovery and resilience in Afghanistan, particularly through sustained support to women-led MSMEs, focusing on protecting community-based livelihoods, expanding access to finance, and strengthening women’s role in the local economy.56 LOOKING AHEAD UNDP will continue to accelerate human development by advancing its support to MSMEs and inclusive value chains across LLDCs, based on its approach to creating prosperity for all by expanding opportunities for MSMEs to access productive assets, decent jobs and livelihoods, and build human capital, while strengthening socio-economic resilience against shocks, crises, and multidimensional vulnerabilities. This entails equipping MSMEs with financing, skills, knowledge, and technologies to cultivate entrepreneurial ecosystems through business incubation and supportive policy frameworks, such as trade policies that connect local producers to regional and global value chains. It also includes expanding access to affordable credit, digital financial services, income generation, and asset-building opportunities, particularly for women, youth, and vulnerable communities. By facilitating decent job creation, improving financial inclusion, linking local producers to national and global value chains, and deepening partnerships with the private sector and civil society to unlock innovation, capital, and expertise, UNDP will continue working closely with governments and development partners across LLDCs to build inclusive and resilient economies that leave no one behind. 18 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 4 Building Climate Resilience and Advancing Energy Transitions in LLDCs LLDCs face innumerous challenges, including infrastructure and energy access deficiencies, inadequate maintenance, losses from disasters, and significant vulnerabilities to accelerating climate and environmental impacts. Regarding energy access, a staggering 215 million people live with limited or no electricity in LLDCs.57 Disparities between electricity access across LLDCs prevail. While 15 LLDCs have achieved electricity access rates above 90% as of 2023, 12 LLDCs still had access rates below 60%, all of which are in Sub-Saharan Africa.58 More so, a significant imbalance remains between urban and rural population groups in LLDCs, with 86% and 62% having access to electricity in 2023, respectively. Meanwhile, the global urban average was at 98% in 2023 and the rural average was 84%, significantly higher in comparison to the average energy access rate for LLDCs.59 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 19 natsinemkruT najiabrezA ainemrA avodloM natshkazaK aiviloB natuhB natsikijaT ainodecaM htroN egarevA labolG CDLL natsikebzU cilbupeR zygryK egarevA dlroW yaugaraP anawstoB ailognoM initawsE ohtoseL lapeN natsinahgfA ewbabmiZ osaF anikruB RDP oaL dahC aibmaZ aipoihtE adnawR regiN iwalaM ilaM cilbupeR nacirfA lartneC adnagU idniruB naduS htuoS FIGURE 6 Share of Population with Access to Electricity by LLDC in 2023 Urban Rural National Average Source: World Bank Open Data (2023) PROGRAMMATIC AREA 4 The share of LLDCs’ overall population with access to clean cooking fuel increased from 40% in 2012 to 45% in 2022.60 There is a significant access deficit in rural areas, which have a 35% access rate, compared with 61% in urban areas in 2022.61 Women are disproportionately impacted by energy poverty in the LLDCs, more so due to domestic reliance on charcoal and wood, and their associated health implications.62 Between 2016 to 2025, renewable energy capacity has grown at an annual rate of less than 10% in developing countries, and within this subset, LLDCs recorded a much lower growth rate of only 2.4%.63 With such annual growth rates and without further interventions, LLDCs are likely to take more than 38 years to achieve the renewables deployment rate similar to the average level across developing countries in 2022.64 Under the Climate Promise Initiative, UNDP is delivering the UN system’s largest portfolio of support on climate action in more than 140 countries and territories.65 This portfolio is worth over US$2 billion in grant financing and also builds on UNDP’s expertise on gender equality and inclusion, energy, poverty, health, climate security, nature and biodiversity, among others.66 Since 2019, UNDP’s Climate Promise supports developing countries in strengthening their climate action by setting and implementing more ambitious goals to reduce emissions (especially through enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement), bolstering climate resilience, and mobilizing financing. Through five key pillars of adaptation, mitigation, carbon markets, forests, and policy, UNDP is supporting countries in designing and implementing bold climate actions aligned with national development goals, including NDCs, adaptation plans, long-term strategies, and green recovery initiatives. UNDP Climate Promise’s portfolio of 140 countries and territories includes support to 31 landlocked countries, namely 5 countries in Asia Pacific (Afghanistan, Bhutan, Lao PDR, Mongolia, and Nepal), 8 in Europe and Central Asia (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, North Macedonia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan), 16 in Africa (Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Central AfricanRepublic, Chad, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe), and 2 in Latin America and the Caribbean region (Bolivia and Paraguay).67 Among its flagship initiatives, the Africa Minigrids Program (AMP) enhances clean energy access across 21 countries, including 9 LLDCs (Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Malawi, Chad, Mali, Niger, Zambia, and Burundi) by promoting sustainable, scalable solar minigrid investments.68 AMP is a USD 50 million country-led technical assistance programme, funded by Global Environment Facility (GEF) and implemented by UNDP in partnership with RMI (founded as Rocky Mountain Institute) and the African Development Bank (AfDB).69 Renewable energy minigrids, and in particular solar-battery minigrids, offer great potential to address the 733 million people globally who currently don’t have access to electricity – including 567 million, or three quarters of the world’s unelectrified population, in sub-Saharan Africa.70 In this regard, the program aims to electrify 265 million people across its portfolio of 21 countries by 2030.71 In addition, in May 2023, the Government of Japan provided72 funding to respond to the growing demand of developing countries supported by UNDP to take climate action and deliver on national climate pledges (also known as NDCs). This includes provision of assistance to 16 countries73 across Asia-Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Africa, and Arab State regions through UNDP’s Climate Promise initiative, including seven landlocked countries: Armenia, Bhutan, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Malawi, Nepal, and Serbia. The partnership has enabled UNDP to advance clean energy solutions and ambitious climate action policies across regions. 20 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 4 PARAGUAY’S ENERGY TRANSITION: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES Paraguay stands out globally for its nearly 100% renewable electricity supply, sourced almost entirely from hydropower. While this offers a clean energy advantage, the overdependence on a single source of energy presents structural risks — particularly as climate change affects water availability and electricity demand continues to rise. Simultaneously, the transport and industrial sectors remain reliant on imported fossil fuels, limiting the country’s energy autonomy and sustainability. UNDP, in collaboration with national institutions and international partners, supported the design of a transformative project to accelerate electric mobility and public transport modernization in the Asunción Metropolitan Area. The project aimed to mobilize over USD 20 million in climate finance to unlock more than USD 150 million in total investment — enabling the deployment of 300 electric buses. This initiative combined public and private funding through innovative financial instruments, structured with strong commitments from multilateral banks and development agencies. The project has completed its technical design phase and is currently in advanced negotiations with international investors, including green funds, sovereign wealth funds, and multilateral development banks. It stands as a clear example of how targeted technical assistance and international climate finance can be leveraged to unlock large-scale investment and drive systemic transformation in the transport and energy sectors. LOOKING AHEAD Looking ahead, UNDP remains committed to supporting LLDCs in overcoming energy poverty and building climate-resilient, low-carbon futures. The Awaza Programme of Action75 emphasizes protecting people’s livelihoods and avoiding disruptions to trade and transport through strengthened resilience in LLDCs against accelerating climate impacts by rapidly scaling up climate finance and infrastructure investments to support both mitigation and adaptation efforts, incorporating disaster risk reduction strategies into all development policies and strengthening early warning systems, and promoting biodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources, especially given LLDCs’ increasing exposure to land degradation and biodiversity loss. These priorities are fully aligned with UNDP’s priorities, which emphasize systemic, scalable change through key levers such as nature-based solutions, sustainable energy transitions, climate adaptation and resilience, circular economy approaches, and the integrated management of land, forests, and water systems, critical for advancing sustainable development and climate action in LLDCs. Guided by these priorities, UNDP will continue to scale up support in key areas such as sustainable energy transitions, energy diversification, and strengthening energy security, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa where the access gap is most acute. In parallel, climate adaptation will remain central, with increased investments in nature-based solutions (NbS) and integrated approaches that link energy access with community resilience and gender equality. Across country and regional contexts, UNDP will deepen its technical, policy, and financial assistance to LLDCs to ensure no country, place, or community is left behind in the global energy and climate transition. 21 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 5 Managing Natural Resources for a Sustainable Future in LLDCs Landlocked Developing Countries face a distinctive set of structural constraints that severely affect their ability to sustainably manage natural resources. With no direct access to coastlines, LLDCs depend heavily on agriculture, mining, and forestry – sectors that are not only vulnerable to environmental degradation but also highly sensitive to global market fluctuations. Over half the land in LLDCs consists of drylands, which are increasingly under stress due to desertification, poor land management, and climate change. This geographical reality exacerbates food insecurity, limits water availability, and accelerates land degradation – making the sustainable management of natural assets both a development necessity and a resilience imperative. The implications are stark: many LLDCs rely on land-based livelihoods, yet they struggle to maintain the ecological integrity of their landscapes. Resource degradation directly undermines food systems and economic productivity. With rising temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, and increasing demand for finite water and soil resources, these countries face an urgent need to adapt. In LLDCs such as Burkina Faso, Mali, and Ethiopia, climate shocks (especially droughts and floods) frequently devastate already fragile ecosystems, deepen poverty, and trigger migration. Without sustainable natural resource governance, LLDCs remain vulnerable to a vicious cycle of environmental decline and socio-economic instability. UNDP’s Strategic Response and Nature Pledge Recognizing the critical nexus between environment, development, and resilience, UNDP has embedded nature-positive development across its portfolio. Through its Nature Pledge, UNDP has committed to help more than 140 countries implement biodiversity and ecosystem-focused solutions by 2030. For LLDCs, this commitment translates into concrete support for restoring degraded landscapes, strengthening natural resource governance, and unlocking nature-based economic opportunities. UNDP’s strategic priorities position nature and climate as one of four core areas of integrated development, emphasizing the link between biodiversity, climate resilience, and sustainable livelihoods. Through the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Green Climate Fund (GCF), and its own financing mechanisms, UNDP has supported LLDCs in mainstreaming ecosystem management into national development strategies, enhancing community-based natural resource governance, and improving access to sustainable land and water use technologies. Examples include climate-resilient agroforestry projects in Lesotho, water resource management in Tajikistan, and dryland restoration efforts in Niger and Chad. These interventions not only aim to preserve biodiversity but also enhance food security and economic resilience, especially for rural populations living in dryland zones. 22 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 5 Country-Level Impact: Tailored, Transformative Interventions At the country level, UNDP’s support reflects a deep commitment to building local capacity and ensuring inclusive benefits. In Bolivia, a country highly dependent on extractive resources and prone to environmental degradation, UNDP has worked with indigenous communities to promote sustainable forest management and integrate environmental governance into subnational planning. In Mongolia, UNDP has facilitated partnerships that promote ecosystem-based adaptation in rangelands, which are critical for pastoralist communities vulnerable to desertification. In Bhutan, which is both landlocked and environmentally vulnerable despite being carbon-negative, UNDP has supported sustainable forest and watershed management as part of the country's graduation strategy from LDC status. In Burkina Faso, UNDP has enabled communities to adopt climate-smart agriculture practices, enhancing soil fertility and reversing land degradation in critical dryland zones. Overall, UNDP’s country programming in the Sahel has increasingly focused on integrating peacebuilding and natural resource management to address root causes of displacement and insecurity. LOOKING AHEAD As LLDCs align with the new 2024–2034 Programme of Action, the centrality of sustainable natural resource management becomes even more pronounced. The new agenda calls for integrated approaches to land restoration, sustainable agriculture, and climate adaptation, especially across drylands and arid zones that are home to the majority of LLDC populations. These approaches must be grounded in inclusive governance and gender-responsive planning to ensure broad-based benefits and long-term sustainability. Looking ahead, UNDP will scale up support in four key areas: (1) Restoration and protection of drylands and fragile ecosystems using nature-based solutions; (2) Policy and institutional support for transparent and participatory natural resource governance; (3) Integration of environmental priorities into national SDG and climate strategies through tools like INFFs and NDCs; and (4) Mobilization of blended finance and private sector investment in sustainable land and resource management. These efforts will be underpinned by a digital and data-driven approach to track ecosystem health and resource use efficiency. In an era marked by climate uncertainty and geopolitical complexity, LLDCs have the potential to lead models of sustainable land use, climate adaptation, and community-based resource management. With its track record, in-country presence, and partnerships, UNDP remains a trusted development partner, ready to help LLDCs transform environmental vulnerabilities into engines of resilience and inclusive prosperity. 23 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 6 Harnessing Extractives for Sustainable Development in LLDCs Extractive industries, particularly the mining and processing of critical minerals, are integral to the economies of LLDCs, representing a significant share of their GDP and labour force. Mineral-rich LLDCs (such as Mali, Burkina Faso, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mongolia) have some of the highest share of mining as a proportion of their total exports globally. Constrained by their lack of direct access to maritime trade routes, several LLDCs rely on their abundant mineral resources to drive economic growth, boost export industries, attract foreign investment, generate employment, and strengthen public finances.76 Critical energy transition minerals, such as copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare earth elements, are indispensable to the transition to clean energy technologies (ranging from wind turbines and solar panels to electric vehicles and battery storage)77 powering the shift from fossil fuels to renewables, with global demand projected to nearly triple by 2030.78 In fact, the production of certain minerals, such as graphite, lithium and cobalt, could increase by nearly 500% by 2050, to meet the growing demand for clean energy technologies,79 promising opportunities for economic growth, job creation, poverty reduction, and local development for mineral-rich LLDCs. Nevertheless, realizing these benefits depends on effective governance. As mineral extraction accelerates to bridge the needs of the energy transition, it is crucial to ensure that the countries and local communities endowed with these resources are the ones to benefit the most, accelerating inclusive growth that leaves no one and no place behind.80 Without proper management, the increasing demand for critical minerals risks perpetuating commodity dependence, exacerbating geopolitical tensions and environmental and social challenges, including impacts on livelihoods, the environment, health, human security and human rights, and can undermine efforts towards the energy transition.81 Furthermore, evidence suggests that moving from raw mineral extraction to manufacturing battery packs and EVs, each step downstream in the production process results in a corresponding increase in the economic and traded value-added of the products in the supply chain.82 Many mineral-rich LLDCs risk being locked in the initial stages of low value-added raw material extraction activities, forgoing broader economic development opportunities such as industrialization, export diversification, and increased value addition from subsequent stages in the critical minerals production and supply chains. In April 2024, the UN Secretary-General (SG) launched the Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals to foster trust among governments, communities, and industry by developing voluntary principles that support a just and equitable energy transition, promote local value addition and inclusive economic benefits from mineral resources, and enhance international cooperation through aligned standards and multilateral action.83 In September 2024, the Panel published its report “Resourcing the energy transition”, outlining seven Guiding Principles and five Actionable Recommendations, as depicted in the Figure below.84 24 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 6 FIGURE 7 A UN framework guiding responsible and equitable mineral value chains for the energy transition.

United Nations Secretary-General’s Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals. Available at: https://www.unep.org/re- sources/report/resourcing-energy-transition 25 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 6 UNDP provides strategic and technical support across mineral-rich LLDCs in facilitating multi-stakeholder partnerships, regional cooperation, negotiations and agreements, knowledge exchange, resource mobilization and access to financing, strengthening of governance processes, due diligence and impact assessments, creation of guidelines, tools, and best practices, and the establishment of policy and regulatory frameworks to ensure that mining and the extraction of critical minerals are inextricably linked to inclusive growth, sustainable development, and a just energy transition that leaves no one behind. In collaboration with UNCTAD, UNEP, and UN Regional Economic Commissions, UNDP is leading the operationalization of the Guiding Principles and Actionable Recommendations of the SG Panel’s report, through the UN Working Group on Transforming the Extractive Industries for Sustainable Development. Furthermore, UNDP has provided special attention to Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM)85, supporting initiatives that promote formalization, improve health and safety standards, enhance environmental sustainability, and ensure that local communities, especially women, youth, ASM workers, and marginalized groups, can benefit from inclusive mineral resource development. FLAGSHIP INITIATIVE: ACP-EU DEVELOPMENT MINERALS PROGRAMME To improve mining conditions, local economic development, and lower mercury pollution, with over €30 million of support from the EU since 2015, UNDP has implemented three phases of the ACP-EU development minerals programme, which provides institutional support to the African Union’s African Minerals Development Centre in improving the livelihoods and inclusion of artisanal and small-scale miners.86 The programme operates in multiple LLDCs, including Uganda, Burkina Faso, and Zambia. ACP-EU has supported ASM mining in these countries, creating jobs, increasing income, and placing environmental and social safeguards. Support has included training on health, safety, and sustainable mining practices, as well as professionalizing small-scale mining cooperatives and enterprises.87 Overall, the programme has led to strong support of ASMEs and the artisanal mining sector, which has improved the wellbeing of miners, and more sustainable and safe mining practices being implemented. The impact of this programme is especially strong in areas dependent on mining, such as the Kassanda District in central Uganda. COUNTRY EXAMPLE: MONGOLIA Mining and critical minerals are pivotal to Mongolia’s economy, accounting for roughly 27% of GDP,88 clearly underpinning national income, investment, and livelihoods, while accounting for 71% of Mongolia’s industrial sector, 77% of foreign direct investment (FDI), and 92% of Mongolia’s exports.89 Mongolia is heavily dependent on coal, underpinning nearly 86% of its total electricity generation and 68% of its total energy supply90, exposing the country to significant economic and environmental vulnerabilities. Along with economic vulnerabilities, such as price fluctuations and the global transition to clean energy, resulting from overdependence on coal, Mongolia is also exposed to major negative public health and environmental hazards of mining, coal production, and coal-power generation, including severe air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, which causes over 7,100 annual deaths annually, and economic losses reaching 10% of Mongolia’s GDP.91 80% of the air pollution in Ulaanbaatar is caused by the use of coal stoves.92 26 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 2 UNDP is leading a UN joint programme, funded by the Joint SDG Fund, to accelerate Mongolia’s transition to green and renewable energy. The project involves creating a national framework for energy transition, developing a climate financing framework, and ensuring a safe and healthy environment, especially for vulnerable populations93. The project not only solved environmental issues, but also presented new opportunities for growth, resilience, and equity, including the development of the renewable energy sector, important for generating economic growth and fighting poverty.94 This project has contributed to pollution levels in Ulaanbaatar steadily decreasing in the last decade.95 However, there is still more work to be done to quicken the transition towards renewable energy. LOOKING AHEAD UNDP remains committed to supporting mineral-rich LLDCs over the next decade in harnessing their extractive industries and critical minerals in alignment with the priorities of the Awaza Programme of Action (APoA) for LLDCs (2024–2034). In line with the UN SG Panel report’s seven Guiding Principles and five Actionable Recommendations and APoA’s emphasis on productive capacity, structural transformation, and resilient infrastructure,96 UNDP will also scale efforts to support artisanal and small-scale mining, while ensuring environmental and social safeguards are mainstreamed across mining value chains. As global demand for transition minerals surges, UNDP will continue to support capacity building, facilitate regional and transit cooperation, and strengthen institutions to help mineral-rich LLDCs advance value addition, jobs and livelihoods, local beneficiation, and responsible investment frameworks, while transforming their extractive dependency towards inclusive, diversified, and climate-resilient economies. 27 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 7 Access to Services in LLDCs: A Cornerstone for Human Development Access to basic services such as health care, education, social protection, clean energy, and safe water is foundational to human well-being and a necessary precondition for inclusive and sustainable development. Yet, for many LLDCs, persistent barriers rooted in geographic isolation, structural vulnerabilities, and limited fiscal space have made the delivery of such services a continuing challenge. Being landlocked often translates into higher transportation costs and logistical hurdles, which can delay or constrain the flow of essential supplies. At the same time, many LLDCs grapple with narrow economic bases, limited institutional capacity, and high levels of informality, which make service delivery at scale a challenge. Fiscal constraints, exacerbated by modest domestic revenues and significant debt servicing obligations, further limit the ability of governments to invest in expanding or improving essential services. These deficits not only hinder progress on the SDGs, but also deepen poverty, exacerbate inequality, and leave large segments of the population, particularly women, youth, and rural communities, without the support they need to thrive. Among the most critical services are health and social protection, which serve as fundamental enablers of resilience, productivity, and economic participation. Health systems in LLDCs are often underfunded, overburdened, and geographically uneven, while social protection systems tend to have limited coverage, fragmented delivery mechanisms, and weak responsiveness in times of crisis. Health Systems Under Pressure LLDCs are home to some of the world’s most vulnerable populations, with 16 of them also classified as LDCs. Public health outcomes in these countries continue to lag behind global averages. Health expenditure as a percentage of GDP varies widely, from 1.87% in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) to 11.38% in Malawi, yet the average for LLDCs remains at just 6.12%, well below the global average of 9.94%97. This low level of investment constrains service delivery and limits progress in improving life expectancy, which has increased at a slower pace in LLDCs compared to neighbouring and similarly situated countries. Historical trends further underscore these challenges. For example, several countries, including Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, suffered dramatic declines in life expectancy during the HIV/AIDS epidemic between 1985 and the early 2000s, with long-term socio-economic consequences. While life expectancy has since improved in many cases, vulnerabilities remain acute. Compounding health-related challenges is the high prevalence of undernourishment and food insecurity. As of 2016, 23.2% of the population in LLDCs was undernourished, and over half (51.6%) experienced food insecurity — figures that have likely worsened with the impacts of climate change and recent global food price shocks. Lack of access to electricity — affecting roughly 40% of the population — further hampers the functioning of health facilities and limits the reach of essential services. 28 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 7 Social Protection: Expanding the Safety Net Social protection systems in LLDCs are often nascent, fragmented, or heavily donor-dependent. Informality dominates labour markets, with limited access to contributory schemes such as pensions or unemployment insurance. In many LLDCs, safety nets do not adequately reach the poorest and most vulnerable, leaving large gaps in coverage and deepening exclusion. The proportion of people covered by at least one social protection benefit in 2023 was significantly lower in LLDCs, with 27.6% compared to the global average of 52.4%.98 UNDP supports countries in building inclusive, adaptive, and sustainable social protection systems as a core pillar of human development and resilience. In the context of LLDCs, where structural vulnerabilities, geographic isolation, and exposure to external shocks often exacerbate poverty and exclusion, UNDP’s approach emphasizes integrated and nationally owned systems that can progressively expand coverage, reduce fragmentation, and respond to life-cycle risks. UNDP works to strengthen the design and financing of social protection, improve coordination across ministries and levels of government, and align social protection strategies with broader development goals, such as employment generation, gender equality, and climate resilience. In many LLDCs, this includes linking cash transfer programmes with livelihoods, skills, and access to services, while also embedding social protection within longer-term planning and crisis response frameworks. Digital technologies offer a promising pathway for expanding coverage and improving efficiency. However, digital divides — both in connectivity and in digital literacy—pose challenges that require sustained policy and financial investment. There is also a critical need to strengthen data systems to ensure better identification of needs, targeting services, and monitoring of outcomes. UNDP’s Contribution UNDP works across LLDCs to improve access to services through integrated, context-specific approaches that address both supply and demand side barriers. This includes strengthening public health systems, improving the reach and efficiency of social protection programmes, and leveraging digital technologies to connect vulnerable groups with the services they need. COUNTRY CASE: TURNING THE TIDE ON HIV IN ZIMBABWE At the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis in 2000, Zimbabwe faced one of the highest infection rates in the world, with over 25% of the population living with HIV99, and AIDS-related deaths exceeding 130,000 annually.100 The epidemic threatened the country’s human capital, food security, and economic stability.101 In response, UNDP partnered with the Global Fund in 2009 to launch a large-scale, sustained intervention. Over the past decade, more than USD 1 billion was invested in prevention, testing, and treatment. By 2023, 1.2 million people were on life-saving antiretroviral therapy, and Zimbabwe had achieved the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets three years ahead of the 2025 milestone.102 New infections fell to 75%, including a 70% reduction among adolescent girls and young women.103 UNDP’s support extended beyond treatment to strengthening Zimbabwe’s health system—retaining 27,000 health workers in 2024, supporting village health workers in remote areas, opening a medical warehouse in Masvingo to expand storage and improve distribution, and equipping over 1,000 health facilities with solar power. They now serve 65% of health facilities nationwide, avoiding over 16,000 tons of CO₂ emissions annually. Today, Zimbabwe is on track to end AIDS by 2030104. It is a powerful example of how sustained investment, strong partnerships, and health system innovation can deliver a foundation for recovery and resilience. 29 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 7 COUNTRY CASE: DIGITAL SOCIAL PROTECTION CARDS IN KAZAKHSTAN In Kazakhstan, more than 980,000 families previously lacked official income records, social protection, or regular access to Government services leaving over 3 million people without a social safety net. In response, UNDP supported the Government of Kazakhstan in developing and implementing the Digital Family Card, a transformative digital platform that enables real-time identification of vulnerable families and streamlines access to services. Launched in 2022, the platform now covers all 5.9 million families in the country and has facilitated the delivery of more than 2.2 million social services. Its companion mobile application serves as a single point of contact between citizens and government institutions, simplifying benefit applications and improving inclusion. This digital innovation has been central to modernizing Kazakhstan’s social protection system and ensuring that vulnerable populations are not left behind in the country’s development trajectory. LOOKING AHEAD While the Programme of Action for LLDCs for the Decade 2024–2034 does not feature access to services as a standalone priority, it underscores their importance within broader commitments to resilience-building, structural transformation, and inclusive development. The Programme highlights the need to strengthen human capital and risk-informed systems, recognizing that limited access to health care and social protection increases the vulnerability of LLDC populations to shocks such as pandemics, climate-related disasters, and economic downturns. It calls for enhanced international cooperation to support the expansion of social protection systems, particularly in contexts where constrained fiscal space hampers domestic capacity to scale up safety nets. Investments in resilient infrastructure, digital public services, and basic human development are presented as essential to ensuring that no one is left behind — especially in remote and underserved areas of LLDCs. In direct response to the priorities articulated in the Programme of Action for LLDCs for the Decade 2024–2034, UNDP will continue to place strong emphasis on expanding equitable access to essential services, particularly health and social protection, as a foundation for inclusive development, resilience-building, and structural transformation. Recognizing the heightened vulnerability of LLDC populations to shocks such as pandemics, climate-related disasters, and economic downturns, UNDP will support countries in modernizing social protection systems to be more adaptive, inclusive, and fiscally sustainable. This will include leveraging digital public infrastructure — such as interoperable ID systems and digital payment platforms — to improve transparency, efficiency, and reach of service delivery, especially in remote and underserved regions. UNDP will also continue to strengthen national health systems and pandemic preparedness through partnerships with WHO, UNICEF, the Global Fund, and other actors. In contexts where constrained fiscal space limits domestic capacity, UNDP will help countries access innovative financing solutions and develop integrated national planning and financing frameworks to align resources with human development goals. UNDP will work to enhance institutional capabilities at national and subnational levels to ensure the delivery of responsive, rights-based services, and will uphold its commitment to crisis resilience by helping to maintain continuity of essential services in fragile and conflict-affected LLDCs. 30 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 8 Investing in People: Human Capital and Skills Development in LLDCs Investing in human capital is critical for LLDCs to overcome the challenges they face, particularly their limited connectivity and narrow economic bases. Strengthening education, health, nutrition, and social protection systems equips people with the skills, resilience, and well-being needed to drive economic diversification, reduce poverty, and enhance social cohesion. Human capital development also enables LLDCs to better harness opportunities in regional and global markets by improving productivity and fostering innovation. Yet, as highlighted by the 2025 UNDP Human Development Report (HDR), global progress on human development has slowed dramatically, marking the weakest growth since 1990 outside of crisis years. LLDCs, particularly those that are also LDCs have fallen further behind, with many not yet recovering to pre-pandemic benchmarks, underscoring the urgency of accelerating investments in human capital to avoid widening inequalities. The HDR argues that without targeted investments in marginalized groups, including women, rural populations, and people with disabilities, efforts to improve human capital risk entrenching, rather than reducing, inequality.105 One of the most widely used measures to track progress in human capital and well-being is the Human Development Index (HDI), which provides a composite snapshot of health, education, and income outcomes. The range of HDI values among LLDCs is considerable, spanning from just 0.388 in South Sudan up to 0.837 in Kazakhstan, which ranks among the highest in the group and underscores the heterogeneity within LLDCs (Fig. 7). LLDCs that are also LDCs tend to cluster at the lower end of this spectrum. The 2025 HDR emphasizes that disparities in HDI between countries are deepening, and that without deliberate policies to reduce inequality in human capital development, many countries, particularly LDCs, risk being locked into low human development traps.106 Education and technical training lie at the heart of human capital development, yet LLDCs face profound disparities in educational opportunities, especially along gender lines, which undermine prospects for inclusive growth and social cohesion. Significant gaps exist between expected years of schooling for girls and boys across many LLDCs, with female students often facing shorter schooling trajectories. In countries like South Sudan, Niger, and Chad, these gender gaps are particularly pronounced, reflecting systemic barriers that disproportionately affect girls’ ability to complete even basic education. Conversely, LLDCs such as Mongolia and Kazakhstan show narrower differences between genders and higher overall expected years of schooling. The 2025 HDR warns of unprecedented declines in learning outcomes, especially among young children, which threaten long-term skill-building and highlight the urgent need for remedial education, stronger teacher training, and quality learning environments. At the same time, the rapid advance of artificial intelligence presents both challenges and opportunities. As highlighted in both the 2019 and 2025 HDRs, equipping people with digital and AI-related skills is now essential for enabling populations to seize new economic opportunities and avoid falling further behind in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.107 31 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 8 FIGURE 8 Top 10 LLDC Recipients of Vertical Funds 2013-2024 (hundred million USD) Low HDI AFGHANISTAN Medium HDI ARMENIA High HDI AZERBAIJAN Very High HDI BHUTAN BOLIVIA Female BOTSWANA Male BURKINA FASO BURUNDI World Average CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC LLDC Average CHAD ESWATINI ETHIOPIA KAZAKHSTAN KYRGYZSTAN LAO PDR LESOTHO MALAWI MALI MOLDOVA MONGOLIA NEPAL NIGER NORTH MACEDONIA PARAGUAY RWANDA SOUTH SUDAN TAJIKISTAN TURKMENISTAN UGANDA UZBEKISTAN ZAMBIA ZIMBABWE Expected Years 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 of Schooling Data Source: UNDP Human Development Report 2025 Statistical Annexes. UNDP’s Contribution Building on the foundations already set out on social protection and health, this section now turns to UNDP’s contributions in developing skills and expanding employment opportunities, key elements of human capital development that enable LLDCs to diversify their economies, increase productivity, and foster inclusive growth. Across LLDCs and other vulnerable contexts, UNDP works with governments, the private sector, and communities to strengthen vocational education and training systems, promote active labour market policies, and improve access to entrepreneurship support. By focusing on inclusive job creation and practical skills development, UNDP helps ensure that women, youth, and marginalized groups can participate more fully in the economy. These interventions aim to align training with labour market needs, foster sustainable livelihoods, and support economic transformation in some of the world’s most geographically disadvantaged countries. In Armenia, in 2024, UNDP supported more than 125,000 people, including displaced populations, with livelihood support and vocational training, modernizing VET centers, delivering competency-based training in areas like welding and solar energy, and rolling out on-the-job training. In Azerbaijan, UNDP piloted digital and green skills curricula in VET programs, expanded dual VET slots across 30 specializations, and introduced inclusive VET courses targeting different groups, including persons with disabilities, and ultimately improving job placement rates. 32 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 8 In Bhutan, UNDP has strengthened career guidance services in technical training institutes and worked with national agencies to develop competency-based curricula, increasing alignment between graduates’ skills and private sector demands. In Mongolia, UNDP revised national employment programs to shift from welfare-based to employment-promoting systems, including profiling tools, apprenticeships, and inclusive vocational curricula for people with disabilities, improving alignment between VET and labour market needs. In Kyrgyzstan, under the SDG Investor Map, UNDP identified technical and vocational education as a key investment opportunity area, helping attract private finance into expanding modern, market-relevant training programs in priority sectors like irrigation and logistics. In Lao People’s Democratic Republic, UNDP collaborated with national ministries to revise occupational standards and strengthen the TVET system, including training of trainers in green skills, enhancing the employability of rural youth and facilitating transitions into sustainable jobs. In South Sudan, UNDP trained more than 6,000 youth (over 60% women) in vocational and entrepreneurial skills, provided startup grants, and supported micro-enterprises, directly creating livelihoods and strengthening economic resilience in conflict-affected contexts. COUNTRY EXAMPLE: NORTH MACEDONIA North Macedonia has made notable progress in employment indicators over the past decade, with the employment rate rising from 38.9% in 2011 to 44.1% in 2017, reflecting job creation and economic growth efforts. Unemployment has continued to decline, reaching 12.5% as of June 2024. However, structural challenges persist more than half of the working-age population remains unemployed or outside the labor force, and informal employment accounts for roughly 22% of total employment, particularly in agriculture. The informal economy is estimated to represent 38% of GDP, contributing to job insecurity and limiting access to social protection. Gender disparities remain pronounced, with a 25-percentage-point gap in labor force participation between women (44.3%) and men (69.3%), alongside a 17.5% average gender wage gap and limited representation of women, especially minority women, in formal employment. Youth unemployment, compounded by emigration trends, continues to erode human capital, undermining prospects for inclusive and sustainable development. UNDP has played a central role in addressing employment challenges in North Macedonia by supporting active labor market measures, skills development, and social inclusion initiatives. Employment and livelihoods have been a top priority, and key interventions include: • Active Labor Market Measures and Entrepreneurship: UNDP has co-implemented flagship initiatives such as “Creating Jobs for All” and the “Self-Employment Programme,” through which more than 35,000 people have applied since 2007 to establish small businesses, supported by training, mentorship, and startup assistance. 33 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 8 • Skills Development and Job Matching: Piloting targeted training modules in key industries (e.g., textiles, construction, renewable energy) and coordinating with private companies to better align training with labor market needs. Initiatives like youth information clubs have facilitated internships and career exploration opportunities. • Social Inclusion and Targeted Support: Tailored employment programs for vulnerable groups, including Roma, women, persons with disabilities, and youth, have provided mentorship, skills training, and support for formalizing work in emerging areas such as the care economy. • Private Sector and SME Support: Through platforms like “bizz4all.mk,” UNDP has promoted entrepreneurship and SME growth to foster an innovative business ecosystem and connect job seekers with business opportunities. • Policy and Institutional Strengthening: UNDP has contributed to shaping national employment policies and strengthening institutional capacities of key stakeholders, improving frameworks for inclusive and productive employment. LOOKING AHEAD The Awaza Programme of Action (2024–2034) recognizes that investing in human capital is essential for LLDCs to overcome the compounded challenges of geographic isolation, limited connectivity, and narrow economic bases, identifying it as a top priority for the decade ahead. It commits LLDCs and their partners to strengthen health, nutrition, and social protection systems, while ensuring universal access to inclusive, equitable, and quality education — including early childhood, primary, secondary, and affordable technical, vocational, and tertiary education. The plan underscores the need to modernize technical and vocational education and training (TVET) systems and develop digital skills to enable participation in modern, diversified economies. It also stresses creating decent, productive employment opportunities for youth, women, and marginalized groups through job-rich economic diversification and support for entrepreneurship and MSMEs. Recognizing that half of the LLDCs are also LDCs, the Awaza PoA aligns closely with the Doha Programme of Action for LDCs, which shares these commitments to enhancing human assets through integrated investments in education, skills development, health, social protection, and decent work. UNDP places human capital at the center of its strategic objective Prosperity for All, emphasizing the expansion of opportunities for decent jobs, livelihoods, and productive assets, while modernizing social protection systems to address evolving vulnerabilities, including those stemming from climate and technological change. UNDP recognizes the urgency of equipping people with digital and entrepreneurial skills, strengthening entrepreneurial ecosystems, and advancing financial inclusion, especially for women, youth, and rural communities. As such, it emphasizes targeted support to integrate women’s economic agency and to build institutional capacity for aligning national development strategies with financing mechanisms that expand human capital. Importantly, UNDP explicitly commits to supporting both the Awaza and Doha Programmes of Action, and looking ahead, will intensify efforts to help LLDCs strengthen health and education systems, close digital divides, modernize TVET, and foster inclusive labor markets. Through these integrated solutions, UNDP will support LLDCs and LDCs in building resilient, inclusive, and competitive economies, accelerating progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and ensuring that no one is left behind. 34 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 9 Financing Sustainable Development in LLDCs: Debt isn’t just a burden - it is a crisis hindering the path to sustainable development and inclusive growth The development financing landscape of LLDCs is characterized by persistent aid dependence, rising debt vulnerabilities, and limited access to productive investments, reflecting both the structural constraints LLDCs face and the broader challenges of financing development in a volatile global environment. Official Development Assistance (ODA) has remained an important pillar of external financing for LLDCs over the past decade. Between 2014 and 2023, total ODA disbursed to LLDCs rose from USD 26.1 billion to USD 32.1 billion, reflecting a modest but steady increase in nominal terms. However, this growth has not translated into increased significance relative to national economies: the median ODA-to-GNI ratio across LLDCs has remained broadly stagnant, fluctuating around 2 percent over the past decade. This suggests that while ODA volumes have grown, their proportional impact relative to the size of LLDC economies has not kept pace. While LLDCs account for a small share of global ODA (approximately 8–10 percent), they consistently receive higher levels of ODA on a per capita basis than other developing country groupings, nearly double the global average108. The significance of these flows within national budgets is large. In many LLDCs, particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, ODA constitutes over 20 percent of government expenditure, underscoring the continued reliance on external support to meet development objectives. ODA allocations to LLDCs have also remained highly uneven and concentrated. A small number of countries, including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Uganda, South Sudan, and Mali, have consistently received a substantial share of total ODA to the group. As illustrated in Figure 11, these five countries alone accounted for nearly half of all ODA disbursements to LLDCs between 2014 and 2023. This concentration reflects both geopolitical priorities and relative absorptive capacity. At the same time, public debt in LLDCs has surged dramatically, driven by a combination of external economic shocks, limited access to trade, and growing dependency on external financing to fund essential infrastructure and development projects. According to the IMF, as of September 2024, five of the eleven countries classified as being in debt distress are LLDCs, including Ethiopia, Malawi, Laos, Zimbabwe, and Zambia, facing acute challenges in meeting their debt obligations, while seven more are at high risk, leaving them highly vulnerable to external shocks that could further destabilize their fiscal positions. Since around 2011, developing economies have experienced what has been termed the “fourth wave of debt”- a period marked by a sustained and widespread rise in public and private borrowing across emerging markets and low-income countries. Unlike previous debt waves, this one has unfolded amid sluggish economic growth, persistently tight global financial conditions, and a shrinking pool of concessional finance. Successive shocks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate-related disasters, and heightened geopolitical instability, have further intensified fiscal pressures. For many countries, including LLDCs, this has created a vicious cycle, where rising debt service burdens constrain investments in development. 35 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 9 FIGURE 9 Official Development Assistance Disbursements 2014 - 2023 (million USD) 40,000 35,000 30,000 25,000 AFGHANISTAN 20,000 ETHIOPIA UGANDA 15,000 SOUTH SUDAN MALI 10,000 REMAINING LLDCs 5,000 0 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Source: Based on IMF World Economic Outlook, October 2024 These global dynamics are playing out with a growing intensity at the country level. Net interest payments as a share of government revenue have increased steeply over the past decade, with the median ratio for developing economies projected to reach 9.5 percent by 2025, the highest level in more than two decades109. While LLDCs are generally below this median (Fig. 10), they have not been spared from the upward trajectory, recording steady increases in debt service burdens, although with somewhat less severe exposure than the most indebted peers. Nonetheless, LLDCs remain structurally disadvantaged: facing higher effective borrowing costs, limited access to concessional finance, and constrained revenue bases, which amplify the fiscal strain. The widening interquartile range in recent years also signals growing divergence among countries, with some LLDCs moving closer to high-risk thresholds. In Africa, LLDCs have seen particularly sharp debt increases due to volatile commodity prices, high borrowing costs, and the impacts of climate change, which strain fiscal resources and compel countries to rely heavily on international debt. In Central Asia, LLDCs face similar debt pressures, amplified by reduced economic growth, political instability, and limited diversification in economic sectors, leaving them vulnerable to external shifts in energy and resource markets. The rise in debt levels threatens development progress, and underscores the need for innovative financing solutions and global support tailored to the unique vulnerabilities of LLDCs. Despite its potential to catalyse sustainable development, FDI in LLDCs has remained insufficient and highly concentrated. According to UNCTAD, FDI flows to the 32 LLDCs reached US $24 billion in 2023, but these inflows declined on average by 2 percent per year since 2014. As a result, the LLDC share of global developing-country FDI shrank from 4.3 percent in 2014 to just 2.8 percent in 2023. Moreover, FDI remains dominated by a few economies, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Uganda, which together received about 60 percent of total inflows during that period. While sectoral distributions have shifted, greenfield investment in extractives dropped from 32% to 20%, and services 36 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 9 projects rose from 27% to 47%, most investments continue to be confined to primary sectors rather than manufacturing or infrastructure. Although some LLDCs have successfully increased public–private partnerships in power and transport, overall FDI remains both narrow in sectoral scope and insufficient in scale to significantly boost productive capacities or diversify economies110.

Although some LLDCs have successfully increased public–private partnerships in power and transport, overall FDI remains both narrow in sectoral scope and insufficient in scale to significantly boost productive capacities or diversify economies⁴. During the implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action, UNDP has played a catalytic role in supporting systemic reforms in financing for development, particularly by promoting investments aligned with the SDGs. Through targeted partnerships and country-level engagement, UNDP has worked to identify SDG-aligned investment opportunities and convene dialogues to raise awareness among investors about the development and commercial potential of such investments in LLDC contexts. PROGRAMMATIC AREA 9 FLAGSHIP PROGRAMME: INTEGRATED NATIONAL FINANCING FRAMEWORK (INFF) FACILITY The INFF Facility is a joint initiative led by UNDP, UN DESA, OECD, UNICEF, the European Union, and the governments of Italy, Spain, and Sweden. It supports countries in designing and operationalizing an INFF, aimed at strengthening the alignment of public and private financing with national development strategies. The Facility provides tailored technical assistance, fosters collaboration across government, private sector, and civil society, and offers a platform for peer learning and access to innovative tools and guidance. To date, over 85 countries globally have adopted the INFF approach including 23 of the 32 LLDCs and with a focus on strengthening financial governance, mobilizing diverse sources of finance, and promoting inclusive financing strategies. These efforts aim to create sustainable, transparent, and efficient financial ecosystems that accelerate progress toward the SDGs and reflect the specific development constraints and opportunities faced by LLDCs. Examples: In Malawi, the INFF process aims to strengthen the country’s 23 financing architecture in support of essential social service delivery at the local level. LLDCs In Kazakhstan, the INFF will support the government’s ambition are actively engaging in to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency of the development of the use of public funds and governance of private finance. INFFS Burkina Faso aims to mobilize all internal and external sources of finance in support of its national development plan and the SDGs. Strengthening financial governance, mobilizing diverse resources, and promoting inclusive financing are core pillars of the INFF approach in LLDCs. Countries such as Armenia, Bhutan, Botswana, and Burkina Faso are improving public financial management and domestic resource mobilization, while Malawi, and Mongolia are diversifying finance through investments in green energy and increased private sector engagement. Inclusive financing strategies are advancing in Burundi, Lesotho, Lao PDR, and Kyrgyzstan, with a focus on public–private collaboration and stakeholder engagement. In Nepal and Tajikistan, financing plans are being tailored to address the needs of marginalized groups, including women and rural communities. UNDP has supported Development Finance Assessments in 11 LLDCs. Many of these countries are now transitioning from diagnostic to action, developing integrated financing strategies and establishing INFF Oversight Committees to institutionalize reforms, strengthen inter-ministerial coordination, and reinforce national ownership of financing priorities. 38 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 9 COUNTRY EXAMPLE: LESOTHO In Lesotho, UNDP’s support to the INFF, in collaboration with UNICEF and IOM, has catalyzed a strategic shift toward gender-responsive and sustainable financing. Facing declining revenues from the Southern African Customs Union and ODA, and a growing fiscal deficit, Lesotho is leveraging the INFF process to bridge a LSL 3.3 billion financing gap in its National Strategic Development Plan II and advance SDG implementation. A key innovation has been the mainstreaming of gender equality into the country’s financing architecture. Building on insights from the 2021 DFA, where over a quarter of recommendations focused on women’s empowerment, the INFF integrates UN Women’s guidance on gender mainstreaming. This has led to gender audits in key ministries, revisions to labour regulations, and the piloting of gender-responsive budgeting by the Ministry of Finance.111 Support for the National Gender and Development Policy (2018–2030), developed jointly with UNFPA, has further institutionalized gender equality across development planning. Lesotho’s INFF now promotes inclusive public-private partnerships and has established new CSO engagement frameworks for budget accountability, with an emphasis on gender and climate. These efforts are helping to advance fiscal sustainability, empower women, and strengthen alignment with international and regional development commitments. LOOKING AHEAD The Programme of Action for LLDCs for the Decade 2024–2034 acknowledges that many LLDCs are already in, or at high risk of, debt distress, aggravated by limited economic diversification, declining FDI, and dependence on a narrow range of commodities. These internal vulnerabilities are compounded by external shocks, including global market volatility and trade pressures. Notably, recent analyses highlight the disproportionate impact of U.S. tariffs on developing countries, which in some cases may harm export revenues and resilience more than the absence of aid⁵. High debt burdens are constraining fiscal space and limiting the policy choices available to invest in infrastructure, social protection, and structural transformation. In response, the Programme calls for stronger international cooperation to support debt sustainability through concessional finance, debt restructuring, and capacity-building in debt management. It also stresses the need to reduce illicit financial flows and enhance domestic resource mobilization to build a more resilient and self-reliant development path. UNDP views financing as a critical accelerator for sustainable development, with its Strategic Plan placing strong emphasis on transforming how development is financed. In contexts where debt distress and limited fiscal space hinder progress, UNDP supports countries in building integrated, inclusive, and forward-looking financing systems. This includes helping governments design and implement Integrated National Financing Frameworks, enhance public financial management, leverage private and blended finance, and access climate and concessional financing. Recognizing that finance must work for people and the planet, UNDP also promotes gender-responsive and risk-informed budgeting, stronger tax systems, and transparency in public spending. In LLDCs, where structural vulnerabilities intersect with constrained connectivity and external shocks, UNDP’s offer aims to unlock investments in resilience, productivity, and regional integration. Through policy advice, digital tools, capacity-building, and partnerships across sectors, UNDP works to ensure that financing becomes a transformative enabler — not a bottleneck — for inclusive, green, and sustainable development. 39 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 10 Driving Digital Transformation in LLDCs The digital landscape of LLDCs is characterized by significant gaps in internet and digital connectivity. Only 39% of the population in LLDCs uses the Internet, whereas over 80% of people in developed countries have Internet access.112 This gap is primarily due to affordability, lack of necessary skills, and insufficient local content. These obstacles hinder technological innovation and economic development. Expanding connectivity and digital transformation in LLDCs is crucial, focusing on connecting hard-to-reach communities - enabling the provision of digital services to vulnerable and isolated communities. LLDCs need support to develop and expand broadband networks and mobile connectivity, promote digital literacy programs, and create platforms for their people, particularly young people, to access digital technologies, improving digital skills and digital literacy. FIGURE 10 Proportion of individuals who used the Internet from any location (via a fixed or mobile network) in the last three months (%) Source: https://datahub.itu.int/data/?i=11624 (ITU) Digital technologies have the capacity to transform development priorities. Internet connectivity presents excellent opportunities for LLDCs, which encounter geographical and structural challenges. Improving internet connectivity in LLDCs would enable the exchange of information and services, enabling businesses to access global markets without being heavily dependent on physical infrastructure. Furthermore, ICTs can improve transportation and logistics efficiency, lower trade costs, and enhance public service delivery in areas such as education and health. LLDCs have great potential in ICTs, but they are not competitive in this area and rely heavily on importing ICT goods. Over the past decade, the percentage of ICT goods that LLDCs export compared to their total trade has stayed below 1%, just 0.6% in 2021. This is very different from the global trend, which saw a 4% increase in ICT goods exports after COVID-19. 40 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 10 Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) also provide huge opportunities for development. AI can increase productivity, support education and human capital development, generate real-time insights from non-conventional data to inform policy, and drive sustainable development.113 However, irresponsible use of AI can cause data privacy violations, cybersecurity risks, misinformation and erosion of trust, and environmental damage.114 Unequal access to AI will amplify the existing digital divide and create further inequality.115 To harness the potential of AI, while ensuring its responsible and equitable use in supporting development, countries will need strategies and frameworks for the regulation of AI. However, almost no LLDCs have comprehensive strategies regarding AI. UNDP’s Contribution In Armenia, Bolivia, Kyrgyzstan, North Macedonia, and Moldova, UNDP has conducted Digital Readiness Assessments to design digital interventions and implement inclusive public services. UNDP has also supported the development of national AI Landscape Assessment (AILA) and has supported the development of a national AI strategy in Mongolia. In Armenia117, Kyrgyzstan118, Kazakhstan119, and Uzbekistan120, UNDP has initiated programmes that provide training for digital literacy and human capital development, allowing individuals to better utilise digital technologies for learning, income generation, and entrepreneurship. These programmes target the youth, as LLDCs often have large youth populations, but often deal with major youth unemployment. UNDP has worked with 13+ countries, including LLDCs such as Malawi, in developing Smart Health Facilities: digitally enabled infrastructure that address challenges facing health systems.121 These smart health facilities can support supply chain logistics, medical waste management, health information systems, effective care delivery, and pandemic preparedness and response. Through the programme, 45,000 smart health facilities have been in operation worldwide, helping deliver over 2.7 billion Covid-19 vaccines, and saving $3 for health facilities for every $1 invested.122 UNDP has supported the development of innovative digital solutions for development challenges with the Digital X project.123 UNDP supported the implementation of Digital Governance Innovation and Transformation (DGIT) legal identity systems in Malawi, which allowed 10 million digital ID cards to be issued to provide access to various government services.124 UNDP also supported Safe YOU, an app that allows victims of gender based violence to issue emergency alerts to authorities and connect with other victims for support, which has saved at least 2 lives and has led to several cases of prosecution in Armenia.125 In Kyrgyzstan, UNDP is supporting the digital transformation of climate risk and disaster risk reduction through the integration of new technologies for communicating risk information, including updating national disaster monitoring systems with modern software and hardware that enables satellite data access. Early-warning avalanche stations improved risk assessments and early warnings to over 60,000 residents, and fire and rescue systems benefitted around 400,000 people.126 COUNTRY CASE: SOUTH SUDAN In South Sudan, communities traditionally have saved money using a financial institution called sanduk, which means “box”.127 The sanduk pools the savings of community members, and lends the funds to those in need at an interest rate set by the community. However, communities depending on sanduk now face challenges such as high-interest rates and limited access to credit, limiting the funds available for entrepreneurs and informal cross border traders. For example, in 41 PROGRAMMATIC AREA 10 2021, sanduk interest rates were set at 30% in the Wararawar Peace market. These challenges have led to mounting debt and financial strain for communities who live in vulnerable borderland communities, who have little access to formal financial services.128 UNDP has led interventions to support the digitization of sanduk to improve access to capital, increase transparency, and support saving.129 The digitalization was done by mapping the concept of sanduk onto mobile digital platforms. This facilitated the accurate tracking of transactions, as well as created group financial profiles, which allowed banks and other formal institutions to extend financial services to members. Through the programme, the implementation of digital sanduk caused a significant decrease in interest rates, dropping from a high of 30% in 2021 to between 15%-20%.130 This reduction of interest rates increased community participation in sanduk, which subsequently increased the lending power of sanduk. Thus, more members were able to access loans for education and emergency medical treatment. Access to financial services for vulnerable populations, who otherwise have limited access to formal financial services, has significantly increased. The success of the digitalization of sanduk in bringing more accessible financial services to vulnerable borderland communities provides a framework for future programmes aiming to digitize and expand access to financial services. LOOKING AHEAD Looking forward, the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) also poses future challenges for development. UNDP will need to support the implementation of national AI landscape assessments in LLDCs.131 UNDP will also need to support countries with AI for human capital development, training, market trends, and forecasting skills, allowing individuals and LLDCs to harness the productive and economic benefits of AI. A major focus of future interventions should revolve around youth in LLDCs. LLDCs are disproportionately young, with youth making up a larger proportion of the population than other countries. To support youth in an increasingly digitised world, and reduce youth unemployment trends common in many LLDCs, interventions need to focus on increasing digital literacy and human capital development. The development of the digital services economy, such as IT, digital creative industry, or financial service exports, are important for LLDCs, as they can be exported without being impacted by the geographical limitations that landlocked countries face. Future interventions need to consider the possibility that AI can exacerbate existing inequalities and further the digital divide. Digital is everywhere, and is becoming essential for individuals to operate in society, access government and financial services, and conduct everyday transactions. Thus, there is the risk for those without access to digital technologies to be excluded from services if everything is digitalized. UNDP must continue to work with LLDCs to expand digital infrastructure and connectivity, increasing the number of individuals in LLDCs that have access to the internet and digital services. Future interventions need to ensure that those without access to digital services can either obtain access or have the ability to access services. 42 Enabling Sustainable Graduation: On the Path Out of LDC Status 16 of the 32 LLDCs are also classified as LDCs, a dual status that reflects the compounded development challenges they face due to both geographic isolation and deep structural economic vulnerabilities.132 These countries encounter persistent barriers like high trade costs, limited infrastructure connectivity, and dependence on a narrow range of commodities, all of which impede sustained progress on key human and economic development indicators.133 FIGURE 13 Mapping LDCs among LLDCs LDCs Non-LDCs Latin American Eastern Europe & Central Asia Sub-Saharan Africa Sub-Saharan Africa East Asia and the Pacific BOLIVIA ARMENIA BOTSWANA MALAWI LAO PDR PARAGUAY AZERBAIJAN BURKINA FASO MALI MONGOLIA KAZAKHSTAN BURUNDI NIGER South Asia KYRGYZSTAN CENTRAL AFRICAN REP. RWANDA NORTH MACEDONIA CHAD SOUTH SUDAN AFGHANISTAN REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA ESWATINI UGANDA BHUTAN TAJIKISTAN ETHIOPIA ZAMBIA NEPAL TURKMENISTAN LESOTHO ZIMBABWE UZBEKISTAN The UN Committee for Development Policy (CDP) uses three criteria to determine graduation from LDC status: Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, the Human Assets Index (HAI), and the Economic and Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI). Many LLDC-LDCs struggle with consistently low scores on the HAI and EVI, reflecting chronic poverty, weak education and health systems, and heightened exposure to external shocks134. These challenges are compounded by their landlocked geography, which increases average trade costs by up to 50 percent compared to coastal LDCs, limiting competitiveness and discouraging investment in value-added industries.135 43 projects rose from 27% to 47%, most investments continue to be confined to primary sectors rather than manufacturing or infrastructure. Although some LLDCs have successfully increased public–private partnerships in power and transport, overall FDI remains both narrow in sectoral scope and insufficient in scale to significantly boost productive capacities or diversify economies. Nonetheless, there have been important signs of progress. Bhutan became the first LLDC to graduate from LDC status in nearly three decades when it successfully transitioned in December 2023. Bhutan’s graduation followed years of steady economic growth, social investments, and effective coordination of its transition strategy with UN agencies, demonstrating that even landlocked countries can meet graduation thresholds with strong governance and targeted support.136 Meanwhile, Nepal and Laos have met the graduation criteria in consecutive reviews (2018 and 2021) and are scheduled to graduate in November 2026, pending successful implementation of their preparatory and smooth transition strategies.137 FIGURE 14 LDC Graduation Criteria Status Meets Threshold Afghanistan Approaching Threshold Far from Threshold Burkina Faso Thresholds: GNI ≥ 1,306 USD HAI ≥ 66 Burundi EVI ≤ 32 CAR Chad Ethiopia Lao PDR Lesotho Malawi Mali Nepal Niger Rwanda South Sudan Uganda Zambia 44 However, for many other LLDC-LDCs, graduation remains a distant prospect. Countries like Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Central African Republic, Malawi, Mali, Niger and South Sudan continue to face instability, protracted crises, and vulnerability to external shocks, including commodity price volatility and climate-related disasters, that stall progress on both income and human assets indicators.138 Recognizing these challenges, countries approaching graduation require smooth transition strategies lasting at least three years post-graduation. These strategies aim to consolidate development gains, maintain access to key international support measures, and strengthen resilience to shocks, ensuring that graduation is both sustainable and inclusive.139 Over the past decade, UNDP has played a critical role in supporting the graduation of LLDCs that are also LDCs, recognizing the vulnerabilities these countries face due to remoteness from global markets, structural economic weaknesses, and heightened exposure to external shocks.140 UNDP’s assistance has included technical advice on meeting graduation criteria, capacity-building for national statistical and planning institutions, and support to develop smooth transition strategies that aim to consolidate graduation gains and minimize risks of reversal.141 For Bhutan and Nepal, UNDP has provided extensive policy and programmatic support tailored to their unique contexts. In Bhutan, UNDP’s engagement was aligned with the 12th Five-Year Plan which prioritized the strengthening of governance institutions to ensure sustainable graduation¹¹. Recognizing that strong and efficient governance is essential for maintaining progress post-graduation, UNDP supported the Royal Government of Bhutan’s commitment to decentralization, including a pledge to allocate 50 percent of the national budget to local governments. Between 2018 and 2019, UNDP helped lead a comprehensive review of Bhutan’s local governance structures and relevant normative Acts—an effort directly overseen by the Prime Minister¹¹. Although the onset of COVID-19 in 2020 required UNDP and the government to redirect resources toward immediate health and crisis response, this flexibility helped Bhutan avoid setbacks that could have threatened its graduation, while continued support for the Local Government Election ensured democratic processes and institutional resilience were preserved.142 In Nepal, UNDP has worked with the National Planning Commission to develop integrated planning frameworks aligned with both the graduation agenda and the SDGs, ensuring that social, economic, and environmental dimensions are addressed in tandem. In both countries, UNDP has partnered with Ministries of Finance and Planning to prepare for the eventual loss of LDC-specific international support measures, including trade preferences and concessional financing.143 . UNDP has strengthened the evidence base on graduation challenges by analyzing emerging issues affecting African LDCs in today’s development landscape and examining the implications of graduation for trade preferences and development financing in Asia-Pacific. These insights are captured in two recent publications: Graduation of African Least Developed Countries (LDC): Emerging Issues in a New Development Landscape (2021), and Graduation from LDC Status: Implications for Trade Preference and Development Financing in Asia-Pacific. UNDP plays a convening role by bringing together governments, regional bodies, development partners, and the private sector to coordinate support for LLDC-LDCs. This integrated approach aligns national policies with international frameworks such as the Awaza Declaration and Plan of Action for LLDCs (2024–2034), and the Doha Programme of Action for LDCs (2022–2031) to ensure that graduating countries are better prepared to sustain progress and continue advancing towards middle-income status after graduation.144 45 Looking Ahead: UNDP and the Next Decade of Partnership with LLDCs As Landlocked Developing Countries enter a new phase under the Programme of Action for the Decade 2024–2034, UNDP stands ready to deepen its longstanding partnership. Building on 60 years of global development experience and a decade of targeted support under the Vienna Programme of Action, UNDP brings a robust platform of integrated policy, financing, and implementation support to help LLDCs navigate the structural and emerging challenges of this new era. Today’s development landscape is shaped by intersecting crises: economic instability, debt distress, climate shocks, and technological disruption. Many LLDCs, particularly those also classified as Least Developed Countries (LDCs), face compounded vulnerabilities that demand more agile, anticipatory, and systemic responses. In this context, LLDCs are not only at the frontline of global development challenges, but also pivotal to global solutions—strategically located at the heart of regional value chains, climate-vulnerable ecosystems, and migration pathways. The next decade must be about unlocking this untapped potential. UNDP’s priorities for the future are aligned with the priorities of the new LLDC agenda, placing emphasis on “prosperity for all”, effective governance, crisis resilience, and a healthy planet, with accelerators in digital and AI transformation, gender equality, and sustainable finance. These areas are deeply relevant for LLDCs. Going forward, UNDP will: ▪ Advance integrated, country-led solutions to support economic diversification, regional connectivity, and resilience to external shocks; ▪ Scale up support to human capital development, focusing on future-ready skills, employment, and inclusive social protection systems; ▪ Promote sustainable financing, including expanded use of Integrated National Financing Frameworks and access to blended finance for LLDC priorities; ▪ Support climate resilience and energy transitions, particularly in high-risk and resource-constrained LLDCs; ▪ Leverage digital transformation to improve access, efficiency, and participation in governance, markets, and services; ▪ Enable structural transformation in critical sectors such as natural resource governance, extractive industries, and MSMEs. Crucially, UNDP’s embedded presence in all 32 LLDCs ensures that these global goals are translated into locally owned, nationally led development solutions. With its trusted partnerships, commitment to leaving no one behind, and experience in fragile and complex settings, UNDP is uniquely positioned to help LLDCs not only adapt but lead in this uncertain global context. Together with LLDCs and the international community, UNDP will co-create a future where landlocked geography is no longer a constraint, but a platform for innovation, inclusion, and sustainable prosperity. 46 ENDNOTES 1 UNDP.

As the global community accelerates efforts to meet the 2030 Agenda, it is in- creasingly clear: gender justice is foundational to peace, sustainable development, and the realization of human rights. In 2024, the Gender Justice Platform advanced its vision of inclusive justice through bold and collective action. Co-led by UNDP and UN Women and made possible through the generous support of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) of Germany, and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) of the United Kingdom, the Platform deepened its impact across 45 countries and territories. Together, we supported over 80 justice institutions, extended legal protection and aid to more than 125,000 people, most of them women, and elevated women’s leadership in the world’s most complex and fragile contexts. Our results go beyond outputs, pointing to meaningful progress toward long-term change. From Guin- ea-Bissau to Yemen, the Platform helped deliver survivor-centred legal services. In South Sudan and Nepal, women leaders shaped constitutional processes. In Latin America and Caribbean, Africa, and Southeast Asia, civil society and governments co-developed strategies to dismantle discriminatory laws and institutionalize equality. These achievements are rooted in intersectional approaches, local ownership, and a commitment to justice as both a process and an outcome. The Platform has grown into a vital multistakeholder mechanism, contributing to UN coordination an engine of innovation while providing space for co-creation, and a driver of feminist justice systems. Its work directly supports the Women, Peace and Security Agenda, the New Agenda for Peace, and UNDP’s Gender Equality Strategy and Crisis Offer. It is aligned with the 2024 Pact for the Future, reinforcing the inseparability of peace, human rights, and development. Most importantly, it responds to the urgent call of women’s movements around the world: to move from commitments to concrete results. We are especially grateful to the government institutions, justice actors, feminist organizations, and grassroots leaders who continue to make this work possible. Their insights, determination, and leader- ship are at the heart of every achievement and innovation. The road ahead remains challenging. Women and marginalized groups continue to face discriminatory laws, underfunded justice institutions, and shrinking civic space, especially in conflict and crisis settings. But with courageous partnerships and sustained investment, the Gender Justice Platform will continue to deliver where it matters most: ensuring justice systems and mechanisms are people-centred, and truly serve women and girls, their communities and societies. Katy Thompson Paivi Kannisto Co-Director, Governance, Rule of Law and Chief, Peace, Security and Resilience Section Peacebuilding (GRP) Hub United Nations UN Women Development Programme (UNDP) Foreword 5 Introduction In a global landscape marked by rising conflict, democratic backsliding, and shrinking civic space, the Gender Justice Platform (GJP) has remained a steadfast champion for the rights of women and girls. In 2024, nearly a quarter of governments worldwide reported a backlash on women’s rights, and 2025 started with a worrying decrease of official development assistance (ODA), particularly impacting work on human rights and gender equality.1 In this challenging context, in 2024, the Platform deepened its commitment to advancing gender justice by driving legal reforms to eliminate discriminatory laws, promote equal rights and strengthening survivor-centred approaches, and promoting inclusive justice systems. Building on the momentum of prior years, the GJP continued to provide direct support in crisis-and fragility-affected contexts, while scaling innovative regional and global initiatives to close justice gaps and expand women’s leadership across the rule of law and security sectors. Amid declining development assistance to justice institutions and limited investment in women’s jus- tice needs, the GJP has served as a vital mechanism to mobilize expertise, catalyze partnerships, and channel resources where they are most urgently needed. With over 50 strategic partners since its implementation and a growing portfolio of work in fragile and conflict-affected settings, the Platform has supported justice services reaching more than 249,000 people—in 2024, 63 percent of whom are women. From transitional justice processes in Colombia and Ukraine to regional leadership networks in Asia and the Balkans, the Platform’s work is grounded in people-centred, feminist approaches and aligned with global frameworks, including the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals. As gender-based violence intensifies and barriers to justice deepen, the Gender Justice Platform continues to play a catalytic role, bridging normative commitments with practical action. In the face of rising threats to gender equality, the Platform’s work is more relevant than ever. As the 25th anniver- sary of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on Women, Peace and Security approaches in October 2025, the Platform reaffirms its commitment to ensuring that women’s voic- es, rights, and leadership are central to peacebuilding and justice processes. By amplifying women’s voices, fostering legal empowerment, and advancing institutional accountability, the GJP is laying the groundwork for more just, inclusive, and resilient societies. This report presents the key results, strate- gic partnerships, and lessons learned from 2024, showcasing how the Platform is sharing knowledge and transforming commitments into concrete change for women and girls around the world.

Introduction 6 Main Highlights In 2024, the Gender Justice Platform supported 45 countries and territories to strengthen rule of law systems that advance the rights and access to justice for women and girls. This was achieved through technical, financial, and policy support, in collaboration with strategic partners from the United Nations, including the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR); external partners such as the International Development Law Organization (IDLO), the World Bank, and Justice Rapid Response; and civil society organizations, including the Tanzania Women Judges Association, the Global Justice Center, and Partners in Justice International. 79,477 women and girls (from a total of 125,264 people) accessed justice services through formal and informal justice mechanisms at the country and regional level; and 76,423 women (from a total of 122,053 people) received legal information and awareness through targeted campaigns and innovative solutions provided and supported by the Platform (including mobile courts, legal clinics and others). 520 women, including survivors of Conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV), participated in accountability and reparations initiatives in Colombia, Kosovo,2 Kenya, Mali, The Philippines and Ukraine. 640 commission staff, investigators and prosecutors received specialized training on survivor-centered approaches and accountability for CRSV, strengthening institutional capacity to deliver justice for survivors. 709 women parliamentarians and women youth received strategic training and support through the Platform to meaningfully participate in constitution-making and legal reform processes in Guatemala, Montenegro, South Sudan and Tanzania. 82 formal and informal justice institutions and systems were supported to deliver people-centered services with a focus on women and girls. Notably, in 2024 the Platform supported 34 informal justice actors, including Civil Society Organizations and alternative d ispute resolution mechanisms in Colombia, Guatemala, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Montenegro, Mozambique, Nepal, Philippines, Senegal, Ukraine, Tanzania and Yemen. 2 All references to Kosovo in this report shall be understood to be in the context of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999). Main Highlights 7 The Platform deepened its collaboration with feminist civil society organizations and associations such as Women's Peace Initiative Alliance from Colombia and Associations of Women Judges in Guinea-Bissau, Tanzania and Senegal, ensuring that their legal, advocacy, and research expertise influenced national legal reforms and global norm-setting processes. Since 2022, the Platform has collaborated with more than 50 partners, reinforcing its role as a catalyst for inclusive, rights- based justice systems. The Platform contributed to global thought leadership by developing and supporting 20 innovative tools and methodologies, and 36 research, knowledge, learning and policy products addressing critical issues such as the reform of discriminatory laws and transitional justice. In response to the persistent challenges of financing for development, the Platform spearheaded the production of the global report Financing Women’s Justice Needs: Global Perspectives on Violence Against Women, and a Case Study on Uganda, in partnership with Pathfinders for Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies, IDLO, the World Bank Group, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), to determine the extent to which national budgets are taking women’s justice needs and responses for gender-based violence. The findings were strategically launched at the 2024 session of the Commission on the Status of Women, catalyzing global dialogue on financing justice for women and girls.

Strategic Global initiatives 13 Key highlights and good practices on women’s meaningful participation in judiciaries Religious and customary courts tend to have lower representation of women Despite achieving parity in formal courts—e.g., women hold 51% of judicial roles in Kenya—they remain entirely excluded from religious courts, which are exclusively male-led. This structural disparity, also present in Nigeria, reveals how religion and tradition reinforce gender bias and must be directly addressed in justice reform strategies. Other justice actors must be considered to support women’s participation, with attention to the legal system In common law systems, judicial appointments often rely on male-dominated recommendation processes, limiting women’s access due to unequal political networks. Ensuring women’s presence in appointing bodies and leadership roles is critical to increasing their representation on the bench. Gender sensitive procedures for women’s effective participation are useful, but political will can have a greater impact Women’s representation increases when more qualified candidates are available, but recruitment processes alone do not drive change. Without political will, quotas risk remaining symbolic, as seen in Malawi. In contrast, Ghana and Nigeria demonstrate that committed leadership can enable women’s advancement even without formal quotas. Ultimately, political will determines whether gender reforms translate into real institutional change. Leadership and champions on gender equality inside the judiciary are key to set positive role models Advancing gender equality in the judiciary requires leadership that not only enforces quotas but models inclusion. In Kenya and Zimbabwe, senior officials’ commitment enabled more women to rise, who, once in leadership, became advocates themselves. This reinforcing cycle of support and visibility is essential to institutional transformation. The accountability process will define the success of the outcome expected regarding gender sensitive measures at the national level The success of gender-sensitive measures depends not just on policies, but on accountability— driven by both civil society and institutional will. In South Africa, advocacy led to reforms when authorities responded proactively; in Kenya, litigation over quota violations, even when dismissed, maintained pressure and advanced compliance. Meaningful change emerges when external scrutiny and internal commitment reinforce each other.

As part of its role in the Working Group on Customary and Informal Justice and SDG16+, the Gender Justice Platform co-sponsored a regional dialogue at the Knowledge Platform Security & Rule of Law Annual Conference in Dakar, Senegal, titled “Strengthening Diverse Pathways to People-Centred Justice in West Africa and the Sahel.” The event brought together key policymak- ers to share findings and recommendations on the role of customary and informal justice (CIJ) in achieving justice for all. It made a strong case for increased and more effective investment in CIJ systems and helped build momentum for their greater inclusion in justice strategies. The dialogue also highlighted the intersection of CIJ with broader sustainable development goals, particularly gender equality, land rights, and environmental justice within the context of climate change. Strategic Global initiatives 15 Lessons learned In 2024, global initiatives reaffirmed the importance of grounding gender justice in survivor-cen- tred, inclusive, and transformative approaches. Key lessons emerged across legal reform, transitional justice, and feminist legal advocacy. Engagement with parliamentarians and other policy makers through platforms like the Global Summit on Gender Equality in Nationality Laws and the 56th Human Rights Council proved effective in advancing legal change. Global con- venings enabled peer learning, while sustained feminist advocacy around the draft treaty on crimes against humanity demonstrated the power of intersectional, long-term engagement to drive systemic reform. A critical takeaway was the need for ongoing support to national justice actors—prosecutors, investigators, and victim lawyers—to strengthen domestic accountability and reduce depen- dence on international mechanisms. Inclusive dialogue platforms in Ukraine and Kosovo under- scored the value of survivor-led, co-designed reparations processes. In Senegal and through the CIJ-SDG16+ Working Group, the Platform highlighted the role of customary systems in advancing gender justice.

Looking ahead The Platform will scale support for CIJ by promoting gender-responsive standards, strengthening local capacity, and deepening policy engagement. The 2024 Financing Women’s Justice Needs report confirmed that underfunding remains a major barrier. The Platform will continue to advocate for gender-responsive budgeting, costed strategies, and sustained investment in justice systems for women.

Ziguinchor convened nearly 100 participants, Lessons Learned In 2024, initiatives across Asia Pacific, Africa, Arab States and East Europe regions reaffirmed that advancing women’s leadership within the justice sector is a catalytic entry point for embedding gender equality across legal systems. Dedicated training, peer learning, and strategic partnerships with institutions such as associations of women judges proved essential to equip women with the tools to lead, influence institutional reform, and drive inclusive development in justice delivery. Structural and geographic barriers are main challenges that hinder women’s full participation, particularly young women in rural areas. The Platform’s work with informal justice actors, such as civil society organizations, association of women judges and jurists has been instrumental in identifying and addressing these barriers through evidence-based tools, such as studies on women’s attrition from legal education and gender audits of justice institutions. Country level results highlights 23 Looking ahead The Platform will scale its investment in women’s leadership through targeted training in Indonesia, Lao PDR, Thailand, Bangladesh, Algeria, and Montenegro, alongside a global exchange under the Justice Futures CoLab in 2025. Legal and policy reform efforts will deepen through the Women’s Leadership and Women in Diplomacy Networks. To expand access to justice, the Platform will prioritize paralegal training and community outreach, strengthening engagement with informal and customary systems and mechanisms to ensure justice services are survivor-centred, locally grounded, and responsive to the needs of women and girls.

Evidence from Kosovo, Mali, South Sudan, and Ukraine underscored that the most effective interventions are those where survivors are not merely re- cipients of services but active participants in accountability, reconciliation, and reform processes. A central pillar of this work is strengthening the capacity of national actors including commissions, prosecutors, investigators, and civil society organizations—through trauma-informed, gender-sen- sitive tools and training to ensure inclusive and effective justice outcomes. In Kosovo and Ukraine, inter-agency coordination platforms and survivor support mechanisms enhanced institutional responsiveness and expanded access to redress. In Mali and South Sudan, local ownership, targeted legal reforms, and women’s leadership were vital to embedding gender equality in tran- sitional justice and peacebuilding frameworks. The Platform’s engagement has highlighted the transformative role of feminist civil society, legal empowerment initiatives, and digital innovation in shaping more inclusive, accountable, and sustainable transitional justice systems. Looking forward The Platform will scale support for national strategies that embed gender-responsive reparations, strengthen survivor-led participation, and deepen South–South cooperation. This includes expanding survivor access to information and services and reinforcing institutional capacity to deliver people-centred justice in fragile and conflict-affected contexts. 6 See this initiative in 2023 Gender Justice Platform Annual Report, page 13.

Country level results highlights 29 Changing Traditions, Restoring Dignity: Stories of Justice for Women Detainees in Yemen: “I thought I would die here.” After completing her prison sentence, a woman in Yemen remained detained for seven more years, abandoned by her family who feared the shame of taking her back. In Yemen, authorities do not release women detainees unless a family member receives them, a barrier that leaves countless women indef- initely imprisoned. With support from UNDP, the legal empowerment team of the Yemen Women Union mediated with the woman’s family and as a result her sons agreed to take her home. \"It’s a mira- cle,\" she said tearfully. \"I thought I would remain here forever and die here.\" Her release marked not only personal freedom but a step forward in challenging the stigma surrounding women detainees. A mother's wait ends in justice. Every day, a mother stood outside a prison gate in Yemen, believing that someone inside could help release her daughter. Lacking resources to hire a lawyer, what she didn’t know was that her daugh- ter had already been found innocent and had a formal release order, but no one had acted on it. The Yemen Women Union’s legal empowerment team, supported by UNDP, uncovered the oversight and swiftly intervened. The daughter was finally re- leased, ending her mother’s daily vigil and restoring justice long overdue. From captivity to shelter and hope. After serving her sentence, a woman remained im- prisoned as her family refused to accept her back, a reality for many women in Yemen where social stigma eclipses legal outcomes. The Yemen Women Union (YWU), with UNDP’s support, secured a refer- ral letter from the prosecutor’s office and arranged for the woman to be transferred to a safe shelter operated by YWU. There, she began the process of reintegration and healing. Her case exemplifies how people-centred justice must extend beyond legal resolution to provide protection, dignity, and support for re-entry into society.

Key Lessons Learned The Kyrgyzstan case study offers critical lessons to inform the Gender Justice Platform’s future programming at the country level. In emerging areas of UNDP’s Global Programme—such as environmental justice and business and human rights—it is essential that gender considerations are systematically integrated from the design stage to ensure that women are not left behind in the development of new legal and policy frameworks. Digital innovations, including chatbots and mobile legal services, have shown strong potential to extend justice access especially for women and girls. However, their effectiveness depends on ensuring they are tailored to the lived realities of marginalized groups. Finally, legal and institutional reforms targeting discriminatory practices in Aksakal courts and other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms have reaffirmed the strategic value of engaging informal justice systems for women at local level to access justice. The Platform will strengthen partnerships with community-based justice mechanisms to expand justice access for women in rural and underserved areas, while promoting alignment with human rights and gender equality standards.

Strengthening evidence-based learning and knowledge-sharing on gender justice 35 The way forward 1 The Platform will continue advancing survivor-centered, gender-sensitive transitional justice in Ukraine, South Sudan, Mali, and expand to DRC, Ethiopia, Liberia, and Nepal. Efforts will focus on strengthening survivor leadership, building people centred justice system capacities, and in- tegrating recommendations from the report Documenting Reproductive Violence into national programming. 2 The Platform will expand support to women’s leadership in justice institutions and systems by launching new initiatives in Tajikistan and Lao PDR. In 2025, national-level training will be rolled out in Tajikistan, Lao PDR, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Algeria, and Montenegro, and a global UNDP’s Justice Futures CoLab on Women’s Leadership will convene national practitioners to exchange good practices and shape strategic direction ahead of key milestones such as the HLPF 2026 and CSW 2026. 3 The Platform will deepen its people-centred justice approach by translating findings from country legal assessments into targeted advocacy and reform initiatives, tailored to the lived realities of women and girls, with a focus at on local interventions. Building on work in Senegal, Tanzania, and across Latin America and The Caribbean, the Platform will support regional strategies and institutional partnerships to strengthen trust in justice delivery. 4 In 2025, the Platform will launch new guidances on people-centred approaches for gender justice and Customary and Informal Justice programming, supporting implementation at country level, including in Armenia, Guatemala and Somaliland. Global events and technical assistance will fur- ther elevate customary justice as essential to inclusive, accessible systems. 5 The Platform will scale innovation and thought leadership, producing new tools and learning products that advance inclusive legal reform. A key priority will be financing for gender justice: in 2025, Uganda Case Study will be launched, following the 2024 Financing Women’s Justice Needs report, to inform policy and investment strategies. This research will help to shape global inputs for the SDG 16 review at HLPF 2026 and CSW 2026. 6 The Platform will continue to strengthen partnerships with feminist CSOs to ensure that their legacy and advocacy expertise continues to shape national reform and international norm-set- ting. For example, in Tanzania, UN Women will continue legal aid efforts with partners like Door of Hope and TANLAP.

Strategic Result Framework This section presents the progress and results achieved by the Gender Justice Platform in 2024, aggregating results across the contexts supported by the Platform vis-à-vis its results frameworks. The Gender Justice Platform falls under a common Outcome on advancing gender equality and increasing women’s and girls’ access to justice, with three common Objectives that focus on gender-responsive and people-centered justice and security services (Objective 1), women’s meaningful participation in justice and security sectors (Objective 2), and shaping the policy discourse on gender equality and the rule of law (Objective 3).

In 2024, the platform is emphasizing its collabo- ration with customary and informal justice institu- tions and mechanisms as part of its commitment 1 Objective 1: The Gender Justice Platform invested in the delivery of gender-responsive and people-centered justice and security services. In 2024, the Gender Justice Platform supported 45 countries and territories, including through technical, financial and/or policy support, in collaboration with strategic partners. The Platform invested in 82 justice institutions to provide people-centred and gender responsive justice ser- vices, including 48 formal institutions and 34 informal institutions, so that they become effective, accountable, and accessible, particularly to meet the needs of women and girls. With the Gender Justice Platform’s support, more than 122,000 people (including over 76,400 women) benefited from legal awareness and legal representation, bringing justice closer to women and girls in Al- bania, Bhutan, Kosovo, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. In addition, more than 125,000 people (among which over 79,477 women and girls) accessed justice services through legal aid particularly at the local level. The Gender Justice Platform continues to prioritize the urgent needs of survivors of conflict-related sexual violence. To this end, in 2024, the Platform trained or supported over 640 national staff- including investigators, prosecutors and transitional justice actors- national staff, in 6 countries and territories on CRSV approaches and legal frame- works, enabling them to better address and respond to the immediate needs of CRSV survivors, in collaboration with government institutions and women’s civil society organizations 2 Objective 2: The Gender Justice Platform actively promoted women’s meaningful participation and leadership in the justice and security sectors to ensure that they are responsive to the needs of people, especially the most vulnerable women and girls. In 2024, with the support of the Gender Justice Platform, more than 660 women increased their capacity to participate in and deliver justice and security services. 12 justice and security institu- tions strengthened their capacity to achieve gender parity in their institutions in over 10 countries, as a key step towards delivering gender-responsive services. The Platform made concerted efforts to promote the meaningful participation of women and youth in law reform and constitutional re- form processes. In 2024, 709 women and youth’s capacities were enhanced to publicly engage in constitution-making and law reform processes. In addition, 520 women directly participated in accountability and reparations initiatives supported in Colombia, Kenya, Kosovo, Mali, The Philip- pines, and Ukraine. The GJP developed 10 concrete initiatives with the main objective of expanding women’s leadership in the justice and security sector. Results Framework 38 3 Objective 3: The Gender Justice Platform has actively contributed to shaping the policy discourse on gender equality and the rule of law through innovative, intersectional, evidence-based analytics and learning. In 2024, the Platform developed 20 innovative tools and methodologies that produced lessons learned on gender justice. In addition, the Platform supported more than 36 research, knowledge, learning and policy products on topics including reform of discriminatory laws, gender- respon- sive rule of law and transitional justice. To disseminate this learning and enable the exchange of knowledge and lessons learned at the national, regional and global levels, the Platform convened and participated in 35 multi-stakeholder events in collaboration with many partners, including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), The Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), International Development Law Organization (IDLO) and the Conference of Constitutional Jurisdictions of Africa.
