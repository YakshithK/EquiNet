    "text": "Today, Global Voices is launching a donation campaign to raise USD 250,000 to keep our news and translation sites running.\n\nHistorically, Global Voices has been primarily supported by foundations and other grant-makers, and we’re grateful for the funding we receive that way. But sharp cuts to foreign aid by a number of governments are shrinking the available funds for nonprofits, with digital rights organizations like ours taking a particular hit.\n\nAnd it’s a hard time for news and translation organizations right now, with new technologies being used to cut staff and mass-produced disinformation crowding out quality news. Even in this challenging time, Global Voices’ production and readership have been going up, but since we are committed to never paywalling and not showing ads, that doesn’t translate into covering our running costs unless readers donate.\n\nGlobal Voices is a relatively low-cost organization to run: we have no office, no rent, and few physical supplies. We pay for the servers that host our site and a few other administrative costs, but by far the majority of our expenses are for paying our staff. Many grants don’t want to fund more than a small percentage of personnel costs, because they want to pay directly for activities, but personnel costs are the basis of all our activities. Our staff and our volunteers research stories, write and edit, translate and advocate — and sometimes they also do graphic design or photo choice, social media promotion, and more. That is who we’re trying to support with the funds from this campaign — our community, the people who make the articles and essays, translations, research reports, and podcasts that you find on our site.\n\nIf we had a dollar for every page view of the site, we wouldn't need to do a campaign! And if each of those dollars were a monthly commitment, we’d be able to plan ahead for longer-term activities and be generally less stressed. But we know that not everyone can contribute for lots of different reasons, so instead we can think about it as five dollars from one-fifth of the monthly site visits, or ten dollars from one-tenth, and maybe someone who hasn't read anything this month but believes in what we do kicks in twenty-five bucks, and someone else who loves translations sends another fifteen and… you get the idea.\n\nWe hope that you can be one of those contributors, and if you can’t right now, we hope you still come and spend time on our site, and then tell other people about it. Even more than a news site, Global Voices is a community, and we’d like you to be a part of it. We’ll be sharing about the campaign and about Global Voices on social media, so please repost so more people learn about us and how they can get involved. Thank you for your support!\n\nDonate",

    "title": "The paradox of women’s rights in Peru",
    "text": "By Grecia Flores Hinostroza\n\nIn Peru, women’s rights exist in a strange paradox: on paper, we have the laws, the representation, and the international commitments that promise equality; in reality, our lives tell a different story. Political progress coexists alongside persistent neglect, with numbers that flatter and figures that fail. This contradiction is not hidden in the shadows — the painful contrast is written plainly in the numbers we so proudly display.\n\nAccording to the SDG Gender Index, Peru scores 72.9 for “Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments,” a figure that suggests progress, visibility, and leadership. And yet, when we shift our gaze to health, the score drastically drops to 35.5, barely half. Women are present in Congress, but absent from the healthcare system that should protect them.\n\nIf political participation alone were enough, our streets would be safer, our hospitals accessible, and our voices heard beyond the voting booth. But in Peru, as in much of Latin America, representation has not broken the chains of inequality — it has simply made them less visible to those who govern.\n\nThe data tells one story. The lives of rural, Indigenous, and poor women tell another — one where access to basic sexual and reproductive health services is a distant reality. Where hospitals, experts, and care are unreachable. As the political scientist Stéphanie Rousseau notes in “The Politics of Reproductive Health in Peru,” “Although health sector reforms have had some positive impact on women’s reproductive health, the many restrictions placed on women’s right to reproductive choices have blocked further progress.”\n\nThe consequences are not abstract. In 2020, Peru’s maternal mortality ratio stood at 69 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the World Health Organization, far above the Latin American average of 45 and nearly five times that of Chile (16) and Uruguay (13). These numbers represent women whose lives could have been saved by timely care, safe births and the fulfilment of rights already recognized by law.\n\nBut these injustices are not only moral failures; they are legal betrayals. Peru has signed its name beneath international promises: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and others. These are not distant treaties gathering dust in diplomatic archives. They are binding commitments, written to safeguard the dignity, health, and safety of women — commitments meant to reach every hospital room, courtroom, and remote village in our country.\n\nLaws protecting sexual and reproductive health rights exist on paper, but they remain distant from the realities of rural, Indigenous, and poor women. Clinics lack essential services. Comprehensive reproductive care is unavailable. Legal frameworks declare equality, but equality disappears in places where women still face forced pregnancies, unsafe births, and systemic neglect.\n\nThe Constitution speaks of equality, but equality does not walk the roads where women carry their pregnancies alone. The Ministry of Health issues protocols, but those protocols do not save lives when the nearest health centre is closed, or when the only doctor is gone. Rights without access are hollow. Commitments without implementation are betrayal.\n\nIn this context, political representation must not be mistaken for liberation. We cannot accept the illusion of progress that comes from more women in office if it is not matched by concrete action to dismantle structural barriers. Empowerment is not an empty slogan — it is the lived reality without fear, accessing healthcare without barriers, and raising one’s voice without retaliation.\n\nThe gap between law and life is not an abstract policy flaw; it is a daily crisis. It is the young girl in a rural province forced to give birth after sexual assault because abortion is inaccessible. It is the mother who dies on the way to a hospital that never has the capacity to treat her. Likewise, it is the Indigenous community where reproductive rights exist only in the language of faraway courts, not in the practice of local healthy systems.\n\nIf we measure success only by the presence of women in power, we ignore the absence of justice in their communities. Numbers in parliament cannot compensate for empty maternity wards. International recognition cannot replace the right to safe childbirth.\n\nI call on the Peruvian Congress to legislate not for appearances, but for autonomy. To ensure that health, safety, and dignity are realities in every province. I call on international donors to fund the fight for reproductive freedom, not just political participation. And I call on Peruvian society to recognize that representation without rights is no victory at all.\n\nRepresentation matters. But it is only the beginning. Real empowerment is when every woman controls her future — her body, her health, her voice — regardless of where she was born or how far she lives from the capital. Until the day, the paradox will remain, and progress will be a promise half-kept.",

    "title": "Pro-government campaign against student protests attempts to justify repression in Serbia",
    "text": "This analysis by Nataša Stanojević was originally published by the International and Security Affairs Centre (ISAC), part of the regional initiative Western Balkans Anti-Disinformation Hub. An edited version is republished by Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nThe protest held on June 28 this year in Belgrade, on the Serbian national and religious holiday, Vidovdan, represented the culmination of months of public discontent with government policies and systemic societal problems.\n\nVidovdan is deeply rooted in national history and collective memory and has often been used as a symbol of political and moral struggle. In this case, students and other citizens chose the date to underscore the seriousness of their demands for responsible governance, to call for snap elections, and advocate for essential institutional reforms.\n\nAccording to estimates, the protest gathered around 140,000 people, making it one of the largest political gatherings in the past decade. The sheer size of the turnout reflects profound social frustration and a sense that institutional mechanisms for expressing discontent have completely failed. However, while the organizers’ demands were clearly defined — fighting corruption, institutional accountability, and democratization of the system — pro-government media constructed an entirely different picture.\n\nInstead of fact-based reporting, the public sphere was flooded with sensationalist headlines and claims aimed at delegitimizing the protests and criminalizing participants. The student movement and citizens were not portrayed as advocates of democratic values, but as a threat to the stability of the state. This strategy of criminalization, typical of authoritarian regimes, allowed the authorities to justify the use of force and intensified repression.\n\nPro-government media in Serbia systematically employ false and manipulative narratives to discredit legitimate civic protests and normalize the state’s repressive responses. Analysis shows that key propaganda tactics include labeling participants, manipulating events, constructing an image of a foreign enemy, and glorifying police force. These practices have long-term consequences for democratic processes and freedom of expression.\n\nInstruments of the propaganda narrative\n\nOne of the most commonly used strategies was the deployment of pejorative labels. Organizers and participants were not referred to as students or citizens but as “blockaders,” “hooligans,” and “terrorists.”\n\nA headline in the tabloid newspaper Informer, “Anti-hooligan operation in the city center: Watch how blockaders are arrested,” illustrates how police intervention was presented as necessary and legitimate, while citizens were criminalized. The term “terrorists” carries particularly strong connotations, suggesting extremism, even though the protests were peaceful in nature.\n\nMedia outlets widely circulated narratives about an alleged “hellish plan” by demonstrators. Headlines such as “Bridges and the entire city under siege: The new hellish plan of blockader terrorists, they want blood and dead bodies on the streets!” create an atmosphere of fear and suggest inevitable escalation into violence. These unfounded claims serve to mobilize the government’s loyal voter base and legitimize repressive measures. Rhetoric about “blood on the streets” and “danger to citizens” not only criminalizes protest participants but also frames them as a national security threat.\n\nPro-government discourse attributed goals to the protesters, such as “destroying the state” and “overthrowing the president.” These claims are not based on any documents or public statements by organizers, whose demands focused on improving safety, fighting corruption, and ensuring political accountability. Introducing accusations of “treason” and “collaboration with enemies” is part of a broader model of political propaganda in which social resistance is portrayed as a conspiracy against national interests.\n\nWhile pro-government media insisted on an image of violent demonstrations, actual events tell a different story. According to reports from independent media and human rights organizations, the majority of the protest was peaceful. This was also confirmed by the Council of Europe.\n\nThe few incidents that occurred happened only after police intervention, during which excessive force was used. The arrests or detentions of hundreds of people, along with documented cases of physical abuse, clearly show that state repression was the dominant dynamic. This gap between the media narrative and empirical facts is a classic example of the framing technique — selective presentation of reality to shape public opinion.\n\nThe broader political context and the foreign enemy narrative\n\nParticularly concerning is the strategy of linking the protests to alleged foreign enemies, in this case, Croatia. Certain tabloids and politicians suggested that the organizers of the protests were instruments in the hands of Croatian intelligence structures and that their goal was the destabilization of Serbia. These claims have no factual basis, but serve a clear propaganda purpose: to evoke historical tensions and use national stereotypes to create a sense of threat among citizens. (The hostilities between Serbia and Croatia have deep roots in their national narratives. These tensions began during the Ottoman Empire when many Serbian refugees were settled in Croatia by the Austrian authorities. The animosity intensified during World War II when Croatia joined the Axis powers, and was solidified during the wars that accompanied Yugoslavia’s breakup. This period culminated in Operation Storm, which resulted in the majority of Serbs fleeing Croatia.)\n\nThe use of Croatia in this narrative has a dual function: first, to mobilize patriotic sentiment; by suggesting that the protests are connected to a “hostile state,” the government reinforces its image as the defender of national interests. Second, it discredits the opposition and civic initiatives; by attributing “foreign influence” to the protests, the government delegitimizes their goals and diverts attention from internal problems such as corruption and institutional breakdown. This rhetoric relies on the well-known model of “constructing a foreign enemy,” which, according to political communication theory, serves to homogenize the electorate and justify authoritarian practices.\n\nA particularly alarming segment of the propaganda campaign concerns the linkage of protests with the issue of Srebrenica. (The 1995 massacre of the Muslim population in Srebrenica and its surrounding areas by the Army of Republika Srpska is frequently exploited by both nationalist and anti-Western factions in Serbia. Similar to narratives that deny the Holocaust, discussions about Srebrenica range from complete denial to unsettling debates about the number of victims, their nationality, and the use of terms like “necessary military action” and “collateral damage.” Over the past 15 years, anyone who does not support these narratives has been labeled a “traitor” or a “Western agent” in official political discourse.)\n\nIn an Informer article entitled “They’ve exposed themselves! This is blockader politics: Accusing Serbia of a nonexistent genocide in Srebrenica,” students were accused of “agreeing with accusations that brand Serbs as a genocidal nation.” This narrative attempts to shift the focus from demands for democratization to a national question, creating the impression that the protests have an “anti-Serbian agenda.” In this way, civic resistance is criminalized through manipulation of one of the most emotionally charged issues in the public sphere.\n\nA similar rhetoric is used by the portal Vaseljenska in the article “Blockaders want to declare Serbs a genocidal nation: Elections, then a government that will recognize the genocide in Srebrenica.” These claims are absent from any official demands of the organizers, but their function is clear: to discredit the protests by linking them with alleged plans to “betray national interests.” Thus, the government constructs a narrative in which students are not only “hooligans” but also agents of dangerous ideological and political projects.\n\nNarrative vs objective facts\n\nIn the long term, such practices lead to the consolidation of authoritarian patterns of governance. When every criticism of regime representatives is labeled as “treason” or “terrorism,” the space for democratic dialogue disappears. This not only delegitimizes protests but also undermines the fundamental values on which modern democratic societies rest.\n\nThis analysis of the media narrative surrounding the Vidovdan protests demonstrates that pro-government media act as a propaganda apparatus whose primary function is the preservation of political power, not informing the public. Through the dissemination of a distorted perception of civic resistance, the construction of violent scenarios, and the invention of foreign enemies, the authorities succeed in delegitimizing valid social demands and justifying repressive measures. Such a strategy may stabilize the regime in the short term, but in the long run, it erodes the foundations of democracy and leads to further political and social crises.",

    "text": "This Dart Centre Asia Pacific Report by Arun Karki was originally published in Nepali Times, and an edited version has been republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.\n\nWhat should a journalist do when young protesters are shot in front of her? Does she do her job and stay neutral? Can you stay neutral?\n\nAs Gen Z protests engulfed Kathmandu, Nepal's journalists found themselves reporting a story that was personal. While doing their job, some of them were even targeted by mobs.\n\nRead More: Gen Z stands up to expose corruption in Nepal\n\nDart Asia Pacific Fellow Arun Karki visited their newsrooms and spoke with his colleagues about their experience of reporting the Gen Z protests that erupted on September 8th. These are the first-hand accounts of journalists who witnessed the turmoil in the city they call home.\n\nSunita Karki was at a workshop in a hotel on September 8th. She saw the first waves of protests through hotel windows. Curfew alerts flooded her phone, a vehicle belonging to a human rights group sat burning across the road, young boys were taking their wounded friends on motorbikes to local hospitals, and police were beating a teenager with their hands raised.\n\n“I cried a lot,” she said, but the tears were not out of fear — they were because she felt guilt. “I couldn’t write the news. We were witnessing these scenes from a five-star hotel.” By evening, the death toll had reached 19. On September 9th at about 3:35 pm, her outlet, the Annapurna Post's office in Tinkune, Kathmandu, was set on fire. Staff had to leave the building as parts of the newsroom burned down.\n\nWhen she knew her office was burning, she anxiously told her husband that she would resign from the job: “If we have to hide our identification cards in every protest, what kind of journalist am I?” she asked herself.\n\nShe filed a story the next day, but her emotions kept bouncing between those of a journalist bound to duty and a civilian in shock. She said that in moments like this, it’s hard to feel truly neutral.\n\nAfter watching the police beat people, she felt a strong urge to step in, not just stand back and report. The first real calm came later, when people came to the street and lit candles together in honor of those who were killed. “This was a sort of victory procession. I felt some relief after brutal days,” she said.\n\nAngad Dhakal a photojournalist who works at Kantipur National Daily, was standing outside his office building when protesters stormed in and set parts of it on fire. He had already been informed that protesters were planning to torch his office building and rushed to his office hoping to save his hard drives containing ten years of photography work. He failed.\n\nHe raised his camera and “forcefully” pressed the shutter — more to document the scene than out of “professional enthusiasm or duty.”\n\n“My office was burning. What should I photograph?” he recalled. A few moments later, a protester noticed the “PHOTO” label on his yellow Press jacket. Dhakal deflected it by saying he was an early-career freelancer and YouTuber. He went into a corner and took his jacket off so that protesters wouldn't target him.\n\nWhen it comes to covering street protests, Angad usually stands near the police because it feels safer. But on September 8th, fire and gunshots made even that area unsafe. A rubber bullet hit his friend Dipendra Dhungana, badly injuring him.\n\nHe thought, “Where do we go now? If we stay here, we’ll be hit.” After witnessing two days of protests, violence, and killings, and seeing his own office burning, he couldn't sleep for days.\n\nThe same afternoon that government buildings burned and media outlet Kantipur was attacked, a message in a protest Discord forum talked openly of “attacking Kantipur.”\n\nRumors spread to other outlets. Outside OnlineKhabar's office, where Gaurav Pokharel works, the newsroom manager said, “Very suspicious people were walking around.” They lowered blinds, avoided windows, locked the front gate, and dispersed staff to other places across the city. The outlet was threatened and effectively locked down, but not torched.\n\nPokharel hid his press ID. “ I never showed the ID card. Sometimes I had to enter the crowd shouting slogans, just to blend in among the protesters,” he said. He watched people fall under gunfire, and he helped pull one surrounded journalist out of a hostile crowd.\n\nGaurav also contributed articles to international outlets as a freelancer. Later, while transcribing an interview of a young protest organizer, he wrote to his editor at an international outlet: “This was very hard to write. I cried many times while doing it.” He had been working at a stretch for days, battling bouts of exhaustion and low blood pressure.\n\nProtesters vandalized and set fire within the Singha Darbar complex housing Nepal Television and Radio Nepal. They tried to disrupt public broadcasting.\n\nSurendra Paudyal began the day with his press ID hanging on his neck, thinking it would let him move freely. But when he reached Singha Darbar around 3:30 pm, the situation felt dangerous.\n\nHe put the ID in his pocket. When asked what mattered most, he answered without pause: life comes first. In that moment, he felt real fear and a strong duty to protect his team.\n\nHis focus narrowed to basic things: stay calm, find exits, get everyone out safely. Later, they were able to keep the 8 pm news on air through a regional link. He felt mixed emotions and a sense of relief that the broadcast continued, but also sadness and anger that their own studio had come under attack.",

    "title": "The great silence surrounding marital rape in Senegal",
    "text": "By Bowel Diop\n\nGender-based violence, including marital rape, occurs worldwide, and often, the perpetrators are the victim's husband. Marital rape is defined as an act in which one partner forces the other to engage in non-consensual sex. A report by Equality, a US-based organisation with offices in New York, Nairobi, and London, reveals that many women are affected by this phenomenon, including many in Africa.\n\nIn private online forums where women post under anonymity, distressing testimonies emerge about the violence they suffer within relationships. Out of respect and for the protection of those sharing their stories, no names or platform details are revealed. Behind these testimonies emerges a chilling reality: that of sexual relations imposed within marriage without the woman’s consent, in other words, the reality of marital rape.\n\nAs violence against women becomes increasingly common, consent is being trampled. The notion of “conjugal duty” still frequently outweighs a woman’s right to make decisions about her body.\n\nIt is in these digital spaces, where distress is voiced and violence normalized, that discussion groups take shape, embodying a form of digital sisterhood. Providing room for listening, support, and open speech, these spaces enable women to challenge together the taboos that restrict their empowerment, online as well as offline. This safe space where women share their experiences underlines the urgency of an open and courageous debate on marital rape in Africa.\n\nA cultural, religious, and legal debate\n\nIn May 2025, the program “Midi Plus” on TFM Télévision Futur Média, based in Senegal, gave national exposure to Oustaz Modou Fall, a Muslim authority in the country. This preacher claims that conjugal duty takes precedence over consent, thereby legitimizing sexual violence in the name of marriage. Speaking in Wolof, he stated:\n\nGnouni loi bi néna sakh sa diabar so beugué teud akk mom té dacoroul daga ko violé . Pfff wakhi dof ! Sa diabar ga takk ko so farata Yallah akk souna Seydouna Mohamed , touki Pape Samba dem tournage soneu baye beugu dé gnibissi beugu teud ak sokhname gnouniko bouné dama soneu damadone fobéré (rires) ga forcéko viol le. Boudé lou amm la , lane moye texte bi. Si diné.\n\nPeople say the law declares that if you force your wife to have sex, that counts as rape. Pfff — absurd, this is your wife, the one you married before God. You travel, you work, Pape Samba [the host], you come back exhausted, you want to be with your wife, and she refuses. She says she’s tired, that she was doing the housework (laughter). So if you insist, it’s rape? If that’s the case, which religious scripture says so? We must be cautious about this.\n\nThe broadcast immediately sparked indignation across social media. On TikTok, activists and legal experts mobilized. The Xam Sa Droit page published a series of videos challenging Modou Fall’s statements against existing legislation. Specifically, it points to Article 320 of Senegal’s Penal Code, which defines rape as any act of penetration “carried out through violence, coercion, threat or surprise.” This is a reminder that marriage does not take away any fundamental rights, and that refusing sex, even within a couple, remains an inalienable right. This effort at legal education was met with strong support on TikTok, as it put consent back at the center of the discussion.\n\nVoices were also raised on X. Nabou Diop Lo, a lawyer and activist for women’s and children’s rights, posted:\n\nLe viol tel que définit dans le code pénal Sénégalais ne fait pas une distinction entre le viol commis dans le ménage et celui commis hors des liens conjugaux. Tout ce qui compte c'est le consentement de la victime. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nRape, as defined in the Senegalese Penal Code, makes no distinction between rape committed within marriage and that committed outside it. What matters is the victim’s consent. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nBut how can a woman dare complain she's been raped when a religious figure claims that a wife’s “no” carries no weight? This dissonance between the law, public discourse, and women’s lived reality highlights the urgent need for legal reform and a clear stance from the authorities.\n\nBy normalizing marital rape, this official rhetoric entrenches an absolute claim over women’s bodies and heavily compounds the moral weight borne by potential victims.\n\nEquality Now’s 2024 report shows that the legal recognition of marital rape differs significantly across Africa. The report notes that countries such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Madagascar, Senegal, and Togo explicitly criminalize marital rape.\n\nIn countries including Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Tanzania, spouses are explicitly exempted from prosecution, except in exceptional cases.\n\nIn Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mali, Uganda, and Chad, the law remains silent on the matter, creating a complete legal void.\n\nSenegalese law on rape and paedophilia, revised in 2020, sets out the definition of rape as follows:\n\nTout acte de pénétration « commis par violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise ».\n\nAny act of penetration ‘committed by violence, coercion, threat, or surprise.’\n\nHowever, the lack of clear legal provisions on marital rape and spousal consent creates a wide scope for interpretation, often to the detriment of the victim. As a result, marital rape is often treated as an ordinary form of domestic violence, rather than classified as a criminal offence.\n\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, for example, an investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde published in February 2024 reported that a humorous TikTok video mocking women’s sexual fatigue sparked amused reactions — evidence that sexual non-consent is not taken seriously.\n\nAccording to figures published in African Health Sciences, 33 percent of women in Africa have been subjected to sexual violence at some point in their lives, with rates rising to 44 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Côte d’Ivoire, 40 percent of women housed in the shelter run by the NGO Akwaba Mousso say they have suffered marital rape.\n\nIn many African legal systems, including in Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, the implicit presumption of consent between spouses prevents marital rape from being effectively recognised as a crime.\n\nWhen feminists raise awareness on the subject, the issue is frequently minimised. In the previously mentioned Le Monde article, Ivorian activist Marie-Paule Okri, co-founder of the Ivorian League for Women’s Rights, told the journalist:\n\nQuand on essaie d’en parler, on nous répond qu’on exagère. On nous inculque depuis l’adolescence que le corps de la femme est fait pour donner du plaisir à l’homme.\n\nWhen we try to talk about it, we are told we are exaggerating. From adolescence, we are taught that a woman’s body exists to give pleasure to men.\n\nYet Article 14 of the Maputo Protocol commits African states to guaranteeing women’s fundamental rights, including health and reproductive consent.\n\nBeyond legislation, it will take a deep change in attitudes to improve women’s condition, grounded in respect for their bodies and equality in relationships.",

    "text": "On October 7, 2023, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), the group that governs the Palestinian territory of Gaza, breached the barrier that has surrounded the densely populated area for the last 16 years, preventing the free flow of people and goods. The militants then launched an attack on 22 nearby Israeli settlements, towns, and military bases, killing around 1,200 civilians and soldiers and taking at least 199 hostages.\n\nMany governments around the world have condemned the attack as a war crime and act of terror, while other governments blamed Israel for setting the stage for these attacks to take place. Since then, many governments have described Israel’s response as disproportionate: the official death toll now exceeds 40,000 Palestinians killed, including over 15,000 children — some experts estimate the actual number to be over four times higher.\n\nFor more, read Global Voices’ previous Special Coverage: Israel’s war on Gaza\n\nThe assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas Political Bureau, in Tehran on 31 July 2024, and a key Hezbollah military commander in Beirut on 30 July have significantly escalated tensions in the region. These targeted killings, combined with the failure to implement a ceasefire, are raising the risk of a war that could engulf the whole region, with potentially far-reaching consequences for global peace and stability.\n\nIsrael’s actions, including its military occupation, settlement expansion, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and recurrent operations in Gaza and the West Bank, have drawn widespread accusations of human rights violations and defiance of international law. This includes an International Court of Justice (ICJ) initial ruling on an ongoing case finding it plausible that Israel is committing genocide and an application by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for arrest warrants against three Hamas leaders — including Haniyeh — and two Israeli officials — including Prime Minister Netanyahu — for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe arrest warrants include one for Mohammed Deif, Commander-in-Chief of Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. the Israeli army claims to have assassinated Deif in an airstrike on July 13 in the Al Mawasi humanitarian safe zone in Gaza — one that killed at least 90 people in a massacre described by United Nations official Scott Anderson as “some of the most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.”\n\nIsrael's military operations and targeted assassinations in neighboring countries continue despite United Nations Security Council resolutions, global calls for a ceasefire, and repeated condemnations from international humanitarian organizations who have labeled them as violations of international humanitarian law. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached catastrophic levels, with an illegal blockade that has led to severe shortages of vital supplies and the threat of a poliovirus outbreak, exacerbating the suffering of the population, with nine out of 10 people internally displaced, many of them multiple times.\n\nThe international community’s failure to enforce a ceasefire or hold Israel accountable has highlighted the limitations of global institutions in managing the crises. The United Nations has failed to mediate effectively, with its resolutions ignored, and global and regional players have not put pressure on Israel to accept or implement ceasefire resolutions adopted by the UNSC or proposed by mediators. This raises significant questions about the effectiveness of international law in protecting civilians in conflict zones.\n\nIn this special coverage, we explore the regional and global implications as well as the challenges facing international law in addressing the ongoing crisis.",

    "title": "How one community in Trinidad & Tobago pushed the culinary boundaries of pigeon peas",
    "text": "By Natalie Briggs\n\nWhen I first met Florence Warrick-Joseph, there were two things I didn’t know. One, we were related in that pumpkin vine way only Caribbean people can be. Two, the doubles I had just bought from her at a pop-up market had a surprise in them.\n\nIt wasn’t the comforting warmth of a bara hot out of the box, leaking through greaseproof paper. It wasn’t the silken tear of teeth into that just-fried pillowy goodness, which, if you’re lucky, will still hold a hint of the crackle of oil.\n\nNo, it wasn’t that.\n\nIt was the filling. Cucumber, check. Sweet sauce, check. The heady bouquet of garlic, cumin and spices was there. But there was something different in the mouth feel. It wasn’t the melt-in-your-mouth consistency of the channa that makes doubles a national byword in Trinidad and Tobago. Tasty, yes … but different.\n\nThe same bouquet is heavy in Warrick-Joseph’s small kitchen, tickling the nostrils, making me think about the last time I ate. “I don’t curry the peas. I stew it,” she revealed, while demonstrating how she puts her spin on the popular street food. This is not her only departure from the norm. The peas she uses? They are pigeon peas.\n\nThese days, it isn’t quite the record scratch moment it was when it first appeared — but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. What we should be discussing is how pigeon peas, the stuff of pelau and coconut milk stew-downs, ended up in doubles. It started as an exhortation to think outside the box.\n\nIn 2014, Warrick-Joseph, a retired registered nurse, decided to do an event management course. Her lecturer asked the cohort to stretch themselves beyond the ho-hummery of birthday parties and christenings for their practicum. She was an avid planter of pigeon peas, one of the many members of the Upper Cemetery Street Residents’ Association in Diego Martin, to do so. They had a bumper crop that year.\n\n“We were walking back down the hill,” Warrick-Joseph recalled. “Me, Errol [her husband] and Mr. Timothy. And he asked what were we going to do with all these peas. My husband said, ‘We will freeze it, we will sell it.’ Because that is what people do to get money to put in the organisation. So I said, thinking out of the box, we could have a pigeon peas festival.”\n\nThe two men were sceptical. Warrick-Joseph continued, “They were like, ‘Nobody ever heard of a pigeon peas festival.’ I said, ‘I’ve heard of a mango festival. I’ve heard of a breadfruit festival. There’s a chocolate festival. Why not pigeon peas?’”\n\nThe stage was set, but the main players were yet to arrive. They had the peas, but it would literally take a village to showcase their versatility. By the time the first festival rolled around in 2015, it was a result of a true community effort. They were able to generate so many recipes, including a version of doubles, that there were enough to fill a commemorative book.\n\n“We got someone to do pholourie,” Warrick-Joseph said. “We got somebody who could do pigeon peas accra. Everybody ended up taking a recipe. We found people in the community who could do these things. The pigeon peas roti was from a woman who did roti, and instead of using the dhal with the split peas, she used the pigeon peas.”\n\nPholourie? Accra? Roti? It wasn’t such a stretch of the imagination. After all, pigeon peas’ nutty, earthy flavour lends itself well to a variety of savoury preparations. That’s why it’s a perennial favourite across the Caribbean.\n\nBut Warrick-Joseph was about to hit me another curveball. That first festival, she came up with four of her own recipes. One for ice cream. One for a punch. One for a pigeon peas wine. Then one for a liqueur. Two of those are sweet. One of them officially qualifies as dessert. The trick was in picking, shelling and stewing the fresh pigeon peas to form the custard base all within 24 hours, while they were still full of flavour. My mind had more difficulty wrapping around the idea of pigeon peas as this creamy, cold concoction.\n\nThere were no such problems with the muffins. As I stood and watched her prepare them, different scents filled the kitchen, this time with her signature spice blend. It was the spice, I realised, that gave it the illusion of being sweet. I hadn’t seen her put a lot of sugar into the mixture. The eventual result was dense, reminding me more of a coconut drop than the traditional muffin with its cakey crumb. Fresh out of the oven, breaking into one was a treat; I could smell the spices wafting up from the steamy centre. There was nutmeg. Some cinnamon, too.\n\nNothing in the flavour screamed pigeon peas. That was more in the texture and the solidity with which it sat in my stomach. One muffin felt like a full meal, which led me to ask about the nutritional benefits of the pigeon peas substitution. I found out that, among other things, they were high in potassium and fibre, and were good for gut flora, diabetics, and women who wanted to lose weight.\n\nIn fact, it was trying to cater to customers who wanted healthier alternatives to doubles that prompted Warrick-Joseph to come up with a recipe for gluten-free bara, made with pigeon pea flour: “The reason for the switch was that people felt they wanted gluten-free. There was a group of people that was intolerant to normal flour.”\n\nThese were what I had really come to see her prepare, the muffins being a delectable side journey. I knew it would be different from the first doubles I had from her, since the bara in that one had been made the regular way, with flour, leavening agent and oil. How different this version would be, both in taste and feel, was left to be seen.\n\nIt was a three-flour mix, including the ground pigeon peas, which resulted in a tacky, sticky sort of dough that was allowed to rest for about half an hour. While it did that, Warrick-Joseph warmed the oil in which she would fry them later, and prepared the pigeon peas filling. We talked about many things while she did this, including her business and her plans to eventually have pre-packaged products in the supermarket.\n\nWhen she deemed the dough ready, she put the peas aside. The low gluten content made it difficult to handle as it tears easily, which is why she prefers to use a pastelle press to shape them, instead of rolling them out the traditional way. From there, the perfect circles went into the warmed oil, where they puff up slightly — nothing like the regular bara, because of the low gluten content. By the time they are done, I’m itching to try them.\n\nWarrick-Joseph presented them to me on a plate, complete with pigeon peas filling, cucumber and a tangy tamarind sweet sauce. I took a bite, and chewed slowly, trying to make up my mind about them. The verdict? All the elements were there. This tasted like doubles. Purists might draw the line at the bara, which was more reminiscent of a soft taco shell — flatter, with a slight, mealy crunch to it — while health enthusiasts might hail it as the thing to make doubles great again.",

    "title": "Meet Esther, an independent journalist reporting from the frontlines of Myanmar",
    "text": "Exile Hub is one of Global Voices’ partners in Southeast Asia, emerging in response to the 2021 coup in Myanmar, focusing on empowering journalists and human rights defenders. This edited article is republished under a content partnership agreement.\n\nMost people spend their lives running away from danger. Esther ran toward it.\n\nAfter finding refuge in Australia under UNHCR protection, she made the bold decision to return to the Thailand–Myanmar border in 2023 to continue her journalism. Now, in 2025, she reports from one of Myanmar’s most dangerous conflict zones often under fire, often uncertain of tomorrow. Yet she remains unshaken.\n\nIn a world where silence is safe, Esther chooses the frontline. Her weapon is truth, and she wields it for those who cannot.\n\nA journey against the current\n\nBorn in Mon State in 1993, Esther has always been someone who could not ignore injustice.\n\n“I have never been able to lie to myself or live in misery. If something doesn’t sit right with me, I have to face it head-on,” she reflects.\n\nLike many young people in Myanmar, Esther initially wandered through different jobs, unsure of her calling. She translated movies, worked as a travel and tour sales representative, and later became a public relations officer at a Korean company. But none of these roles felt right.\n\n“I couldn’t stay where I felt trapped or compromised,” she shares.\n\nHer turning point came in 2018 when she attended a basic journalism course. “That’s when I realized writing and sharing opinions was what I had always loved. It felt like home.” After the course ended, she landed her first journalism job at an ethnic media house.\n\nWhen the coup changed everything\n\nBy 2021, Esther was working with a major media house. When the coup hit, her newsroom relocated to Karenni State, and Esther went with them, continuing to report under dangerous conditions. But even after escaping to Australia for safety, the pull of truth was stronger than comfort. In 2023, she made the decision to return.\n\nA few months after she arrived in Thailand, the military made a desperate announcement. In February 2024, the military reactivated its conscription law, mandating that men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 serve in the army. Evading service or helping someone evade could lead to five years in prison.\n\n“As the number of these conscription stories grew, so did my determination to report them,” Esther recalls. But working as an exiled independent journalist came with its own struggles. With no regular income and the constant need for resources, continuing her work was a challenge. That’s when she applied for Exile Hub’s Critical Voices Fellowship 2024 and received it.\n\nBearing witness on the frontlines\n\nEsther began collecting stories from those most affected. She spoke with young men who had fled their villages, fearful of being conscripted. She also interviewed women who had watched brothers and husbands taken by the army, leaving families uncertain and anxious about their loved ones’ fate.\n\nIn September 2024, she published “I Don’t Want Others to Face What I Faced: Stories of Forced Military Conscription,” giving a voice to those the regime wanted silenced.\n\nLater, she followed with another hard-hitting piece, “Snatched from Their Beds, Taken on the Streets — The Young Men in Myanmar Forced to Fight the Junta’s Losing War.”\n\nToday, Esther works deep inside one of Myanmar’s most volatile conflict zones, a place where the sound of gunfire and the threat of airstrikes are constant. Despite the risks, she is satisfied with witnessing the truth with her eyes and documenting and reporting on it.\n\nEsther is more than a journalist. She is a lifeline for those whose cries would otherwise vanish in the dark. And no matter the risk, she will keep writing and keep reporting, because for her, silence is never an option.",

    "text": "Environmental groups initiated global activities and protests from September 18 to 21 to drumbeat the call for urgent climate action amid the worsening pollution and continuing deterioration of the natural ecosystem. The series of protests were held right before the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and less than six weeks away from the UN Climate Summit (COP30) in Brazil.\n\nIn Asia, the “Draw the Line” campaign highlighted the demand to phase out fossil fuels, build renewables, shift to sustainable food, and prioritize the people’s basic needs over corporate interests.\n\nSeveral countries participated in the campaign led by a network of environmental groups and community-based organizations.\n\nIn the Philippines, the campaign was actively supported by local groups resisting projects and policies that threaten the lives and livelihoods of rural and coastal communities. A fluvial protest was organized in the town of Culasi in Antique province, located in the Visayas islands of the Philippines, to call attention to the demand of the small fisherfolk against the entry of commercial fishing operations in municipal waters. Javie Barcinal of 350.org Asia echoed the stand of small fishers.\n\nSmall fishers are among the worst affected by the climate crisis, with warming seas resulting in dwindling catches each year. To make matters worse, the government has allowed industrial fishing to encroach into municipal waters. This exacerbates climate injustice that small fishers experience as hunger for their families.\n\nIn Indonesia, environmnetalists organized at least 36 actions in 34 cities and provinces across the country on September 18, to push for bold reforms in government policies. A march was held towards the State Palace on September 19 as rallyists reiterated the anti-corruption demands of the youth-led protests that erupted in the country last month. Sisilia Nurmala Dewi of 350.org Indonesia led climate advocates in asserting an end to corruption to fund a better future.\n\nWe draw the line as flash floods drown the innocent, while people’s voices against government failures are being silenced. Oligarchs and polluters have ruled this country for far too long, taking public money for climate action and destroying natural resources that should be preserved for future generations. We demand real, decisive action. President Prabowo must honor his promises by committing to 100 percent renewable energy in 10 years and a clear immediate plan to phase-out coal plants.\n\nPaskah Toga of Climate Rangers Bali cited the recent flooding disaster in Bali island to rally public opposition against fossil-based power plants.\n\nThe recent deadly floods in Bali is clear evidence that the climate crisis is no longer a distant threat but a reality that needs to be resolved with concrete policies. The government must stop building fossil-based power plants and phase out fossil fuels.\n\nIn Japan, protesters challenged the new leadership to phase out fossil fuels and to reverse policies that blame immigrants for the country’s social woes. Masayoshi Iyoda, 350.org Japan campaigner, summed up their demand.\n\nWe draw the line on Japan’s rising contributions to climate chaos and war. As we experience both flash floods and extreme heat, workers suffer and food prices continue to soar. Japan’s new leadership must show political will to phase out fossil fuels and shift to 100% renewables, instead of going with the far-right tide of blaming immigrants for our economic woes and backsliding on climate action.\n\nThe protest was also attended by activists who expressed solidarity with Palestinians by condemning the continuous bombings and military attacks in Gaza.\n\nIn South Korea, Jiyun Gim of the Green Environment Youth Korea urged authorities to comply with the planned emissions reduction this year.\n\nSouth Korea’s 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) will be determined in November. We are drawing the line to prevent South Korea from setting a climate goal that falls below 60% emissions reduction. This is not just about numbers—it is the survival line for future generations. The government must set ambitious, science-based, and future-oriented climate targets.\n\nIn Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh, community residents staged an action denouncing the planned revival of a coal plant. Shahrukh Karim, a youth leader in Matarbari, articulated the sentiments of the local community.\n\nWe are burning, our lands are dying, and our rivers are drying up. We draw the line on building another coal plant, when the existing one has already driven away thousands of families and turned our homes into a wasteland. This needs to stop.\n\nCommunities Draw the Line on Matarbari Coal Plant 2 Revival https://t.co/2IT1VPkF5P pic.twitter.com/9E05xBK9xV — Energy & Power (@enpbd) September 20, 2025\n\nIn an email interview with Global Voices, 350.org Asia Communications Manager Ilang-Ilang Quijano shared their initial plans on how to sustain the campaign.",

    "title": "Africa charts bold path towards green inclusive development at the second Africa Climate Summit",
    "text": "Over 6,000 delegates gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, for the second Africa Climate Summit (ACS2), held from September 8 to 10, to search for Africa-driven solutions ahead of negotiations for the United Nations 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the world's largest annual environmental conference.\n\nThe second Africa Climate Summit was organized to unite African leaders, youth, and partners in pushing for fair climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s role as a solutions hub, while preparing a common position ahead of COP30 negotiations. It was a pivotal moment for Africa to stake its claim as a leader in the global climate conversation. Leaders, activists, and young innovators came together to push for reforms in climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s youth voices. The gathering was themed around “Accelerating Global Climate Solutions: Financing for Africa’s Resilient and Green Development.” Ethiopia’s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, opened the event with a keynote that set the tone:\n\nAfrica should not be seen only as a victim of climate challenges, but as a continent of solutions and innovations that could guide the world forward.\n\nHe also proposed the “Africa Climate Innovation Compact” to produce 1,000 innovators by 2030, financed and owned by Africans.\n\nThis vision was built on the momentum of the inaugural summit in Nairobi in 2023, which, importantly, was preceded by the African Youth Climate Assembly (AYCA). By doing so, organizers ensured that the majority-youth population of Africa was not just represented but central to shaping the conversation.\n\nThe challenges Africa faces\n\nAfrica continues to wrestle with the painful legacy of historical injustice and the harsh reality of a deepening climate crisis. Despite contributing the least to global emissions, the continent feels the impacts most acutely. Climate finance remains painfully inadequate as wealthy nations have consistently fallen short of their yearly pledge, and African countries today pay back about five times more in debt servicing than they receive in climate aid.\n\nThe cost of this imbalance is causing hospitals to stretch beyond capacity as diseases like malaria and cholera spread more widely under shifting climatic conditions. Crops are failing under the weight of prolonged droughts or sudden floods, leaving farmers with empty fields and families without food. Coastal cities, from Lagos to Dar es Salaam, face rising waters that sweep away homes, businesses, and livelihoods.\n\nYet at the same time, Africa holds some of the richest renewable resources on the planet. If harnessed, its solar capacity alone could power the world many times over. Africa holds 17 percent of the world’s population but receives just 3 percent of global climate investment. Restrictive financial systems and predatory loan arrangements often force African countries back into reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nEcoVista, a youth-led ecological justice movement whose main focus is on climate justice and the environment, based in Nairobi, Kenya posted on its X account:\n\nFossil fuels are the biggest driver of the climate crisis, responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. #MakeThemPay\n\nDraw The Line pic.twitter.com/N9aUDWl8e8 — EcoVistaKe (@EcoVistaKE) September 19, 2025\n\nLayered on top of that is a painful reminder of colonial history. While Africa’s minerals powered industrial growth in the Global North, the continent was left behind with ecological damage and struggling economies. Yearly natural disasters including cyclones, floods, and expanding deserts displace millions every year, and pushed African leaders at ACS2 to adopt the Addis Ababa Declaration, a clear and urgent call for change.\n\nWith regard to the consequences facing Africa, Tangwa Abilu, a Cameroonian Climate and Environmental Activist, shared on X :\n\nThe horn of Africa is grieving because their\n\n-Their farms are no longer yielding\n\n-Advancement of desert is alarming\n\n-Our major rivers are drying\n\n-Proliferation of pest and pathogens\n\n-Development of tropical diseases.\n\n-Our crop are dieing out.\n\nClimate change is a reality. pic.twitter.com/2MQ5fZG1Zo — Tangwa Abilu.🌿🌏🌾🍀🍃.SDG's. (@AbiluTangwa) December 29, 2024\n\nIn the same context, K. Diallo, an African author, drew attention to the damage caused by floods in December 2023. He posted on his X account:\n\nflood disaster in the DR Congo is a result of global warming meeting a failed state…..The global South bears more than 95% of the costs and deaths related to climate change despite making up less than 5% of consumption-based cumulative emissions above 350ppm CO2. pic.twitter.com/vTDobNNVl5 — K.Diallo ☭ (@nyeusi_waasi) December 31, 2023\n\nDemands ahead of COP30\n\nFor African leaders, climate finance must shift from symbolic promises to meaningful reparations. They argue that financing should come as debt-free grants rather than loans that deepen dependency. Historic polluters owe this to frontline communities losing their farms to drought or their homes to rising seas. The Loss and Damage Fund, in particular, needs to prioritize these vulnerable communities with direct, rapid assistance: cash for families in sinking villages, support for starved farmlands, and investment in healthcare for climate-induced trauma. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said:\n\nToo often, Africa's story begins with what we lack: finance, technology, time. Let us instead begin with what we have: the youngest population in the world, vast solar resources, and the resilience to build a new climate economy.\n\nLeaders are also demanding stronger commitments from rich nations. During last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries from the global north pledged to pay USD300 billion in climate finance, but the amount falls far short of the USD1.3 trillion per year needed by African nations, who need it to effectively adapt and transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nACS2 came at a crucial moment when the Lake Chad Basin, which once supported millions across Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic, had shrunk by over 90 percent. With it, the livelihoods of countless families have evaporated. Africa is both the most vulnerable to climate collapse and one of the most promising centers for climate solutions. As the world heads towards COP30 in Brazil in November, Africans say they do not just want to be heard, but are demanding to be recognized as solution builders and shapers of the planet’s shared future.",

    "title": "The legacy of ‘sponge cities’ left by Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian",
    "text": "Yu Kongjian (俞孔坚), 62, the Chinese landscape architect who pioneered the concept of “sponge cities,” died in a plane crash in the Pantanal region, the largest tropical wetland in the world, in Brazil, on September 23, 2025. Three other people also died during the accident: pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, and filmmakers Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., who were both working with Yu to create a documentary about sponge cities. The cause of the crash is under investigation.\n\nFerraz’s work focused on nonfiction productions, including a series about the 2016 plane crash involving the Brazilian football team, Chapecoense. Crispim Jr. worked on projects such as a documentary about Brazilian architect Vilanova Artigas and another about the first women’s football national team in Brazil.\n\nBrazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, posted condolences on his X account and highlighted Yu's work:\n\nFoi com tristeza e consternação que recebi a notícia do desastre aéreo ocorrido no Pantanal no início da noite desta terça-feira, 23. A tragédia, infelizmente, custou as vidas do piloto Marcelo Pereira de Barros, dos documentaristas Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz e Rubens… — Lula (@LulaOficial) September 24, 2025\n\nIt was with sadness and consternation that I received the news about the aircraft disaster that happened in the Pantanal regional, early Tuesday night, the 23rd. The tragedy, unfortunately, took the lives of the pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, documentarians Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., and the Chinese architect Kongjian Yu. In times of climate change, Kongjian Yu became a world reference for sponge cities, which unite life quality and environment protection: something we want — and need — for the future. To all the victims’ friends, family and coworkers, I leave my deepest sorrows.\n\nYu’s legacy\n\nYu was in Brazil to work on a documentary, but he had also recently attended the São Paulo International Architecture Biennale, which was themed “EXTREMES — Architectures for an overheated planet.” Raquel Schenkman, the Institute of Brazilian Architects’ president, responsible for the Biennale’s organization, told G1 Yu was “someone on the frontline of transformations in big urban centers facing climate change.”\n\nOn its website, the Biennale published a note saying that, as the “creator of the theory of sponge cities, Yu Kongjian left a monumental legacy, also urgent to face climate crisis in cities,” and that his work, based on ecosystemic principles, “showed in a practical and poetic way how the landscape can be a vital infrastructure to urban resilience, integrating man to nature in a sustainable way.”\n\nSponge cities concept\n\nYu’s main legacy is designing and implementing projects based on his sponge cities theory. A professor at Peking University, his “sponge city” concept became a top national priority in China in 2013, following the massive floods in the Beijing region in 2012, which left 79 people dead and tens of thousands displaced. He also founded Turenscape, one of the main landscape architecture firms in the world, based in China.\n\nYu cautioned against overly “grey” cities that rely too much on concrete and asphalt, which disrupt natural water pathways and prevent the ground from absorbing water. While conventional water management focuses on draining water through engineered drainage infrastructure, such as pipes and water channels, sponge cities rely on techniques such as green roofs, rainwater storage and infiltration systems, sunken green spaces, permeable pavement, bioretention ponds, wetland revitalization, restoring natural waterflow pathways, and more.\n\n“Floods are not enemies,” Yu explained in an interview with WeForum. “We can make friends with floods. We can make friends with water.”\n\nYu’s approach to urban planning has been successfully implemented in dozens of cities in China, particularly after Chinese President Xi Jinping established his thoughts on ecological civilization in 2018.\n\nIn the past decade, his natural landscape approach is becoming an important tool in city planning and water management around the world.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, where recurring extreme weather events routinely cause massive floods that displace hundreds of thousands, many city planners are looking to sponge cities as a potential solution for unprecedented levels of rainfall.\n\nSo far, the concept has mostly been implemented on a small scale in individual neighborhoods, streets, or areas, meaning its flood mitigation impacts are often limited to the local level, rather than city- or nationwide.\n\nOn X, Zhongshan city's tourism promotion outlet, commemorates Yu's death by highlighting one of his landscape projects in the southern Chinese city:\n\nOn September 23 (Brazilian time), Professor Yu Kongjian from the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at #Peking University, tragically passed away in a plane crash at the age of 62. Professor Yu had won numerous world-class #design awards, including the Oberlander Prize and the John Cobb Common Good Award. Among his representative works is the #QijiangPark in #Zhongshan, #Guangdong . This #park, transformed from the site of a former shipyard, opened in 2001 and quickly gained global attention, winning several domestic and international design awards. In designing and building the park, Professor Yu and his team preserved the original industrial relics, such as shipyard machinery, docks, and other structures, and repurposed them with new functions. [original English version from @Amzhongshan]\n\nYu himself acknowledged that scaling up the pilot projects in Chinese cities was challenging. One of his sponge city projects in Zhengzhou faced backlash after a severe flood in 2021, which claimed 12 lives in the city, prompting many to express doubts about the practicality of his idea. Moreover, as China's coastal regions are highly industrialized, they demand cross-departmental collaboration, strong political will, and extensive administrative coordination to restore concrete riverbanks and seawalls to wetlands.\n\nIn an interview with Brazilian news outlet G1, Yu said that on a scale of 1 to 10, his optimism regarding the world’s chances of reversing climate change ranked 4. He also mentioned water scarcity — one of the challenges his projects aimed to address — as the primary issue humanity will face over the next 25 years.\n\nA journalist living in China, Isabela Shi, shared Yu Kongjian’s last update on a Chinese social media platform:\n\n🕯️No último vídeo que o arquiteto chinês Yu Kongjian divulgou na rede social chinesa, ele estava mostrando a viagem a Pantanal com equipa brasileira que tenta refletir sobre Planeta Esponja através de encolhimento de zonas húmidas. “Wonderful, amazing”, encantou ele pro Brasil. pic.twitter.com/fKn5ZKgIwe — Isabela Shi🇨🇳🇧🇷 (@ShiIsabela) September 25, 2025",

    "title": "How a comics school taught perseverance and creative freedom in Bosnia & Herzegovina",
    "text": "This article by Adin Kadrić first appeared in Balkan Diskurs on September 12, 2025. An edited version is being republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement with the Post-Conflict Research Center (PCRC).\n\nEditor's note: Zenica is a city in the middle of Bosnia and Herzegovina with about 100,000 residents. It is noted for its ironworks industry as well as being home to one of the big prisons in ex-Yugoslavia, described in the cult rock song Zenica Blues. It is not often considered when speaking about art, making the significance of this initiative — which began during the war of 1992-1995 and still persists to this day — even more extraordinary.\n\nFor over 30 years, the Zenica School of Comics has been not only an illustration school but a symbol of perseverance, cultural resistance, and lasting dedication to art. Initially conceived as an escape from the repression of the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and later, a platform for expression and creativity, the school has trained around 200 young artists. About 70 of them have gone on to become prominent young authors, whose works have left a mark on the domestic and regional comics scene.\n\nSeveral graduates are even acclaimed beyond the borders of their country, with Kenan Halilović, Biljana Šafaražik, and Zdravko Cvjetković being some of the most prominent. While the school has been synonymous with quality and creativity within the domestic comic scene for years, the international acclaim for these artists’ work underscores the fact that Zenica maintains a firm foothold in this visual medium.\n\nRecalling its beginnings, Adnadin Jašarević, the school’s founder and director of the Zenica City Museum, said that its primary goal was to give children a creative escape from the harsh realities of war. Under such conditions, comics were like Alice in Wonderland — providing an escape from hunger, fear, and shelling. An average of ten students still pass through the school every year, learning how to translate their thoughts, fears, and hopes into dynamic sequences of frames and speech clouds.\n\nNewer names like Filip Andronik, Milorad Vicanović, Senad Mavrić, and Enis Čišić represent the contemporary wave of comic artists from BiH. They actively cooperate with renowned publishers from the United States and Europe, demonstrating that despite its underdeveloped infrastructure, Bosnia and Herzegovina has comic creators who can stand equally alongside the best talent the genre has to offer.\n\nPublications such as “Horostop,” “ZE strip,” “EKO strip” and “SUV – Steps in Time” were created at the Zenica School, showcasing both its longevity and its dedication to comic culture. Explaining that the students themselves choose the topics they work on according to their own interests, Jašarević noted that he has “never stopped working” to ensure that comics remain a tool for expression and creative release.\n\nAs far as technology’s impact on the comic industry goes, Jašarević explained that while comics used to be widely available to the masses, they are now becoming a far more exclusive product, with expensive integral editions and albums intended for a small but loyal audience. While the idea behind ​​comics as a liberating medium remains the same, the development of technology has heralded a turn in modern-day comic production.\n\nCartoonist and former Zenica student Zdravko Cvjetković, in speaking about the impact of technology, emphasized that smart tablets have made drawing easier and faster for many artists, without compromising the quality of their work. However, he warned that AI tools — such as those used for generating text and images — pose serious ethical and aesthetic questions.\n\nHe believes that the mass availability of tools that produce images and stories in seconds, threatens to trivialize art and blur the line between creativity and automation: “If we all become artists just because we have a tool in our pocket, then nobody is really an artist.”\n\nMany things about comics today, according to Cvjetković, are drastically different than before the war: “Comics are no longer accessible to such a wide audience, especially children. They’re too expensive and rarely found in newsstands.”\n\nThe burgeoning Bosnian comics scene\n\nPointing out that children today reach for screens before print media like comics or books, Cvjetković said that publishers are therefore targeting older generations who grew up with comics.\n\nA positive outcome of this is the growing number of comics festivals in the region, which promote a culture of reading and drawing. “Workshops and comics contests for children [are] an almost mandatory part of every serious festival,” Cvjetković emphasized, “and this is crucial in the absence of comics schools like the one in Zenica.”\n\nComics culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina persists despite its modest ecosystem, in which there is almost no institutional support, and few major publishers or specialized festivals. However, thanks to the enthusiasm of individuals, the scene is not disappearing; in fact, it is quietly but steadily growing.\n\nAuthors like Berin Tuzlić and Enis Čišić have been representing BiH on the regional and international comics scene for years. Tuzlić, known for his experimental approach and multimedia projects, combines comics with music and animation. Čišić, who also tried his hand at Marvel productions, represents a more contemporary, technically precise form of expression. Their work shows that the country is producing talent capable of competing globally.\n\nIsmet Erdić also holds a special place on the BiH comics scene, with his rare combination of historical storytelling and visual narration in comics about Kulin Ban and medieval Bosnia. His work has educational value and is often used in classrooms, which makes him one of the few authors whose comics reach the general public.\n\nDespite unfavorable conditions for comic distribution, publicity, and marketing, comics culture in BiH is still preserved as a niche interest by enthusiasts. Social networks, web comics, and regional cooperation with authors from Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia are currently key to their survival. So, while relatively small, the BiH comics scene has an authentic flair and great potential, waiting for better times ahead.",

    "text": "In Togo, a national initiative built on civic solidarity helps relieve parents’ yearly back-to-school expenses.\n\nEducation is free and compulsory throughout the country, with a population of over 9.5 million. Following a two-month break (from mid-July to mid-September), more than 3 million students returned to school this month. While the authorities continue to work on improving education through teacher training and recruitment, investing in renovations and school infrastructure, the parents’ main priority is seeing their children succeed at the end of each school year.\n\nOver the years, there has been a marked increase in the gross enrollment rate and the proportion of Togolese students completing the school year. In April 2025, the local news website Lechiquier published:\n\n…le taut brut de scolarisation au primaire dépasse 100%. Il était de l’ordre de 111,70% en 2023, 116,70% en 2024 et une prévision de 116,20% pour l’année 2025. Dans le même sillage, le taux d’achèvement du primaire a évolué de 88,80% en 2023 à 94,60% en 2024. Pour l’année 2025, le gouvernement table sur une augmentation de 121,70%.\n\nThe gross primary school enrolment rate now exceeds 100 percent. In 2023, it was approximately 111.70 percent, in 2024 it was 116.70 percent, and 116.20 percent is forecast for 2025. Similarly, the primary school completion rate increased from 88.80 percent in 2023 to 94.60 percent in 2024. For 2025, the government forecasts an increase to 121.70 percent.\n\nThis rate of over 100 percent is due to it far exceeding the initial estimated value.\n\nFree school education\n\nTogo is one of five African countries with high enrollment rates in school, an impressive development stemming from the various reforms the authorities have implemented in the education sector. In 2008, Togo introduced free pre-school and primary education in the public sector. Since the beginning of the 2021–2022 school year, education in public secondary schools has also been free, a measure the authorities will maintain for the 2025–2026 school year.\n\nThese measures help combat inequities in accessing education. However, efforts, such as providing student school kits (notebooks, books, pens, pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, and school bags), are still required to tackle inequality and ensure universal coverage.\n\nTogo’s guaranteed monthly minimum wage (SMIG) increased from FCFA 35,000 (USD 64) in 2012 to FCFA 52,500 (USD 95) in early 2023. Although this measure was introduced to support the Togolese working population of over 4 million, not all are content with its implementation, condemning the country’s ongoing poor economic situation and challenging living conditions.\n\nAssociation contributions\n\nGiven the financial crisis, parents’ biggest concern is purchasing back-to-school supplies and kits. However, Togolese civil society provides solutions. Citizens, both young and old, are quick to lend their support to help parents meet these expenses.\n\nNumerous citizens, working as part of various associations, travel to the country’s villages and remote areas, assisting and supporting children, especially the most vulnerable. These efforts are a social and solidarity-based alternative to the associations committed to child protection, education, and development.\n\nOne example is Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (the Togolese Child Protection Association or LTPE). On August 29, 2025, LTPE supported 5,000 children from 12 villages of the Amou Prefecture in the Plateaux region.\n\nLe 29 août 2025, plus de 5 000 enfants de la préfecture d’Amou venus de 12 localités différentes ont reçu des kits scolaires grâce à l’initiative « Éducation pour tous : 1 élève, 1 kit, 1 choix de vie » portée par la #LTPE. pic.twitter.com/LMroVuE9oY — Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (@LTPE_ONG) August 30, 2025\n\nOn August 29, 2025, more than 5,000 children from 12 different locations in the Amou Prefecture received school kits through the #LTPE initiative ‘Education for All: One student, one kit, one life choice.’\n\nIn an interview with Togolese media outlet Plume d'Afrique, Nina Afi Kazoulé, the LTPE coordinator, explained the scope of this measure:\n\nNous voulons par cette action éviter le décrochage scolaire. Et nous savons que le décrochage scolaire peut être dû à l'incapacité financière des parents, aux grossesses en milieu scolaire, bref à tous les comportements qui ne sont pas appropriés à adopter par un apprenant.\n\nWe want to prevent school dropouts with this measure. We know that school dropouts can happen due to the parents’ lack of financial resources, pregnancies among school girls, or any inappropriate student behavior\n\nIn the village of Zooti N'titikope, Vogan, a town 45 kilometers northwest of the Togolese capital Lomé, the Togovi Bé Sourire association and Action for Peace and Good Governance (APGG) joined forces with several other associations on September 5 and 6 to support young learners. More than 300 vulnerable children received school kits, and 20 young girls will be monitored and supported in successfully reintegrating into school.\n\nLomé also has vulnerable children supported by other groups, including the Premiers Pas pour l’Enfance (First Steps for Children or 3PE) association. Its mission is to promote equal education opportunities through solidarity initiatives, such as the payment of school fees and supply provision for children. Association President Akilou Demon told media outlet Ledefenseur:\n\nNous voulons que tous les enfants aient accès à l’éducation, car l’enfant a droit à l’école. Si certains en sont privés, ce n’est pas juste. Notre ambition est de leur donner une chance égale de réussir et de contribuer demain au développement de notre patrie.\n\nAs children have the right to attend school, we want all children to have access to education. Some are deprived, and this is not fair. We aim to give them equal opportunities to succeed and one day contribute to our country’s development.\n\nAlthough the results of various reforms are visible, shortcomings remain in Togo’s education system.\n\nSchool infrastructure, such as classrooms, is substandard, especially in villages. Students study in straw huts with few school benches (supplemented in some places with bricks) and are forced to move or interrupt their lessons due to adverse weather conditions. In 2021, these circumstances led to construction plans for 30,000 classrooms equipped with wooden class benches. However, in September 2024, the government reduced its improvement projects by more than half, going from 30,000 classrooms to just 14,632.\n\nWhile civil society can offset some of the education system’s shortcomings, it’s ultimately up to the state, which declared education free and compulsory, to improve education quality and train new teachers to achieve equal opportunities for all Togolese children.",

    "title": "In Brazil, Romani people living in peripheral areas fight for recognition of their identities",
    "text": "This article, written by Artur Ferreira and Amanda Oliveira, was originally published on May 30, 2025, on the Agência Mural website. An edited version is published on Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nIn the collective imagination, the Romani people are associated with colourful clothing, parties, accessories, and an aura of mystery, embodying a wandering spirit. But beyond the stereotypes, there is a rich history of resistance and belonging that spans centuries, including in Brazil, in the outskirts of São Paulo.\n\nIn universities, public offices, doctors’ offices, or their traditional campsites, they are fighting for their rights, against prejudice, and for recognition in a country where there are still shortcomings in caring for the diversity of these communities.\n\nIn Itaim Paulista, a neighbourhood at the eastern end of the city, 250 people live in one of the main and oldest Romani campsites in the region.\n\n“Some Romanies palm read, dance, get dressed up in traditional clothing, but some are even evangelical, like myself, and they don’t all even live in camps. We are a people like any other,” the 32-year-old housewife Magda Santos says. She has been living in the camps for eight years with her husband and two children. “I am not Romani by blood, but I became one when I got married to one.”\n\nThe Romani, also known as the Roma peoples, are an ethnic group that doesn’t have a single origin. One of the more widely accepted theories is that they are of Indian origin but have travelled the world since the 11th century in a great diaspora, dispersing throughout the Balkans, Western Europe, and later to other continents.\n\nWhile she was hanging clothes on the clothesline, 29-year-old seamstress Viviane Alves Pereira made sure to find an answer when asked about the main problems her people face. The statement came without hesitation: prejudice, invisibility and the lack of access to basic rights, a common scenario in marginalized neighbourhoods.\n\nWho are the Roma people from the outskirts?\n\nThe majority of Romani who live on the outskirts of Greater São Paulo are of the Calon ethnicity, like Magda and Viviane. They are also those who suffer the most prejudice relating to maintaining their traditions and being most recognized as “gypsies” (a term now considered derogatory), because of their clothing and their nomadic lifestyle, according to sources from this report.\n\nIn Brazil, there are two other Romani ethnic groups: the Roma and the Sinti peoples. They don’t wear traditional clothing, so they mostly go unnoticed in the cities.\n\n“Many Brazilians were already cared for by doctors, nurses and Romani lawyers, and maybe they don’t even know,” states activist Nicolas Ramanush, 64, who is the president of the NGO, Romani Embassy of Brazil (Embaixada Cigana do Brasil), in Santo André in the Greater São Paulo area.\n\n“In the region, Romani people were concentrated in the neighborhood of Itaim Paulista and in the cities of Itaquaquecetuba and Itapevi, with camps near the train stations,” he says.\n\nEach ethnicity is divided into subgroups, and each one develops its own customs, habits, religions and rituals. “In my ethnic group, for example, we always wear decorated shoes with a lot of details. Some Calon women are famous for their flowery dresses and for using handkerchiefs,” says Ramanush, who belongs to the Sinti ethnicity.\n\nThis group has the fewest number of people in the country. “Today, if there are 100 families in Brazil, it is a lot,” says Ramanush. “This is because of the period of Nazism. The Sintis were almost exterminated. Among the Romani killed during the Holocaust, the majority were Sinti and Roma,” he adds.\n\nRamanush notes that many aspects of Romani culture are integrated into the Brazilian lifestyle without most people realizing it. They were among those responsible for helping Carnival to grow, especially in the northeast, creating Carnival street blocks. Certain costumes, such as “La Ursa” (The Bear) in Recife, have a Romani origin.\n\n“Instruments like the seven or six-string guitar were brought to Brazil by the Roma people. Some samba dancers spoke about how living with the Romanies inspired them musically,” Ramanush says.\n\nUnder the canvas tents\n\nNomadic and outskirt-dwelling Romani have a routine defined by difficulties surrounding education for their children and lack of healthcare, caused by the lack of a stable address. They also face São Paulo’s structural problems, such as floods, and living under canvas tents, without safety.\n\nOne of the most impactful natural disasters was the flooding in February 2025 in the far east of São Paulo, in the region known as Jardim Pantanal. The streets and houses remained underwater for several days. The Romani in these camps had to face that situation under the tents.\n\n“We spent days underwater, and it was the neighbors from the region who helped us,” Santos remembers with outrage.\n\nThe camp’s inhabitants had to deal with a lack of drinking water; tents were affected, and according to local accounts, they had to make a joint effort to avoid major losses of furniture and appliances while the flooding advanced.\n\nJust like Santos, Ramanush believes that the first step to improving the Romani community’s life in the outskirts of Brazil is for them not to be invisible.\n\nPrejudice and invisibility\n\nEven with initiatives such as the National Day of Roma Peoples, commemorated every May 24 since 2006, some rights are still neglected. For example, Romani people are not recognized in the national census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).\n\nSantos remembers the difficulty she faced in registering her children’s ethnic group in their identity documents. Since there is no official recognition of “Romani” ethnicity, she ended up registering them by their skin color.\n\n“There are policies catered to Indigenous peoples, Black and Brown people, but not for Romani people. We have our own culture, but we do not show up, which is why I say being Romani is being invisible,” she claims.\n\nRamanush experienced a similar situation when a census taker visited him during the most recent census in Brazil in 2022. “She asked me what my race was, and I answered that it was not on the list. My complexion is white, but I’m a Romani.”\n\nIBGE estimates that Brazil has between 800,000 and a million Romani, but the Roma groups believe the numbers are higher.\n\n“I've already travelled all over Brazil meeting Romani people from all ethnic groups. Without official data, there are no efficient public policies,” Ramanush explains. “Even to count how many Romani there are in each city or town, local governments make the process difficult.”\n\nBesides the lack of recognition, Romani people living in peripheral areas also face a prejudice that runs through generations. They have been accused of theft, robbery, and deception for centuries. It wasn’t rare to have them associated with kidnapping children.\n\nTrying to change this reality and fight prejudice, Romani groups have been mobilized for the approval of a bill making teaching Romani culture and history in schools mandatory — modeling what already happens with Black and Indigenous people in Brazil. The proposal presented by federal deputy Helder Salomão (PT, Workers’ Party), at the Chamber of Deputies as Bill 3547 of 2015, has made little progress.\n\nIn their justification, the text reinforces the idea that for centuries Romani groups have been experiencing prejudice, marginalization, exclusion and persecution. So, the bill aims to “change the image of Romani populations, trying to reduce prejudice and discrimination that these groups are subjected to.”\n\nThe bill also asserts that providing visibility for Romani groups “will provide a more fertile ground to build public policies focusing on the promotion of human rights.”",

    "title": "Cambodian and Thai activists unite to end hostility and promote peace over border disputes",
    "text": "This article was published by Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand. An edited version has been republished by Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement.\n\nBetween July and May 2025, tensions between Thailand and Cambodia over a border dispute devolved into violence that left at least 43 dead on both sides, dozens injured, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Despite signing a ceasefire agreement on July 28, hostility has remained deeply embedded in both countries, fueled by misinformation. Amidst the turmoil, Cambodians and Thais have come together to launch a cross-border campaign aimed at combating hatred and promoting empathy and lasting peace.\n\nThailand and Cambodia share over 700 kilometres of border, where several undemarcated sections have been long-standing sources of conflict between the two countries, since the Preah Vihear dispute beginning in the 1950s, to this year when clashes broke out on May 28th and led to fatalities on July 24th. On top of that, the countries also share historical and cultural ties, which have complicated the tensions between them, leading to deep-rooted hostility between the two peoples.\n\nHostility skyrocketed after the July 24 armed conflict as the conflict between the two governments trickled down to all facets of society. Cambodian and Thai netizens traded accusations on who initiated the clashes.\n\n“We see all the problems start to unfold, and when hatreds, prejudice, and discrimination on people’s level have gone online, it was even more devastating for us, and that's why we decided to come together on the Cambodian side to rally among ourselves,” said Lim Solinn, a Cambodian social activist and artist. She later reached out to friends in Thailand in different places and then stumbled upon a group of Thai people who are a network of solidarity.\n\nOu Tepphallin, a Cambodian labor rights activist and campaign co-organizer, said she joined the campaign to address the suffering of migrant workers and communities caught in the crossfire of recent tensions, particularly Cambodian workers in Thailand and Thai workers in Cambodia.\n\nThey faced physical violence and racism, and they were living with fear, so their voices were unheard. On top of that, children living along the border have lost opportunities to study due to the closure of border crossings. Family members were separated, such as a child whose mother was in Thailand but whose father was in Phnom Penh, and they have no idea when they can be reunited.\n\nIn addition, according to the Thai authorities, the conflict since July 24th has also caused over 500,000 Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand to return home, since most of them felt unsafe and threatened in Thailand. This has left Thailand with a significant labor shortage as Cambodian migrants typically played an essential role in the country's agricultural industry.\n\nSolinn stated that both Thai and Cambodian campaign organizers want the campaign to go viral in both countries and send messages to leaders saying, “Please don't use violence on Cambodian or Thai migrant workers.”\n\nThe campaigners are also trying to figure out catchy ways for this campaign to go viral and reach regular Thais and Cambodians. The campaign includes writing poems and making songs, which they believe could help calm people and encourage them not to hate simply because of what they heard or saw on the news.\n\n“We’re just starting, even if the war ends tomorrow, the hatred continues, so we need to continue this work and reach out to more communities in Cambodia and in Thailand,” said Solinn.\n\nPhallin added that it's time to heal those who suffered from both sides, and that is what the campaign did by starting to send healing messages to ordinary people.\n\nWhen hatred is louder than empathy\n\nIn Thailand, when the armed conflict erupted and innocent Thai civilians and military personnel were killed, many Thai netizens demanded tit for tat retaliation. In addition, right-wing influencers have threatened Cambodian migrant workers and called on patriots to use violence against them.\n\nOften, those who oppose this and call for a peaceful approach face condemnation online for being too optimistic or unpatriotic.\n\n“All the ordinary Cambodians want nothing but peace and harmony with our neighbours, and a lot of people get caught in between these polarizations, and because of the level of their vulnerability, they cannot get their voices heard at all,” noted Solinn.\n\nOn the Cambodian side, Solinn remarked that while they wanted peace and for this war to stop, most Cambodians also became enraged and emotional when they saw news about civilians being affected, schools being bombed, or news that many people were displaced.\n\nShe disclosed that since she and her friends launched the campaign, she has been harassed by netizens from both countries. For her, it has been difficult to get through to people how the hyper-nationalistic, violent narratives are spreading hate. Solinn said:\n\nThey have been misinformed and disinformed. They believe these sets of stories, and they have these perspectives, and it's hard to change. So, instead of trying to tell them a different version, we’re trying to appeal to their consciousness. We try to appeal to their empathy.\n\nEven though most of the information they received was not real, it was effective as it was coupled with prejudice, stereotyping, and hate speech amplified by social media. “It has added fuel to the fire of ultra nationalist perspectives. It just made it really hard for people to try to bridge across for people who are like us,” said Solinn.\n\nShe insisted that engaging with the same outrage and accusing each other of doing what each side thinks is wrong will not improve the situation, particularly for disputes that have been going on for hundreds of years, based on selective history from both sides.\n\nSolinn emphasized that it was time to put people’s lives first. Children should be able to return to school instead of living in refugee camps, families should be able to earn their livelihoods again, and both countries need to recognize the damage the conflict has inflicted on their economies.\n\nA call for peace: rebuilding trust and fostering empathy\n\n“We would like to urge the leaders to sit down and find a peaceful resolution and put the people first,” said Phallin. She also urged the leaders to negotiate and rebuild trust, insisting that peace can be achieved only by negotiation, not war.\n\nIn the meantime, Solinn urged the leaders to be compassionate and gentle and to reach a peaceful resolution, adding that a tremendous amount of strength is required. The campaign organizer also called on leaders on both sides to stop this war and allow everything to return to normal for the sake of the innocent people from both countries.\n\nShe suggested that Thailand and Cambodia stop promoting biases and stereotypes based on selective interpretations of history, particularly for the younger generations.\n\nSolinn also believes that when this war ends, Thais and Cambodians will come together to create mixed communities where people from both sides could share safe spaces and raise awareness of peace and harmony.\n\n“Educating in school or through the media wouldn't be enough. We need all the spaces, all the communities, we need a whole society to heal and to promote racial tolerance, peace, solidarity, and harmony,” said Phallin.\n\nIn terms of media, Solinn said media, particularly mainstream media, in both countries should not amplify hateful rhetoric, which has already been dominant on social media, but rather people’s stories, which would help promote reconciliation and peace, suggesting that selective parts of the history on both sides shouldn’t be allowed to frame the whole narrative about Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nShe noted that we did not know everything, but only heard different sides of the story. Each side believed the other started the war first or believed that the other side encroached upon their land.\n\n“Trust is so fragile. It's so easy to break, and it's broken already. It's very hard to rebuild, but we must try. We do not have a choice,” noted Solinn.",

    "title": "The judiciary’s dilemma: Protecting Nigeria’s whistleblowers without legislation",
    "text": "Nigeria’s whistleblower policy, introduced on December 21, 2016, was designed as a quick fix to expose systemic corruption. It promised whistleblowers between 2.5 and 5 percent of recovered looted public funds. However, while the policy incentivizes disclosures, it does not guarantee protection.\n\nInstead, whistleblowers often face surveillance, dismissal, or even death threats. Multiple attempts to pass a whistleblower protection bill over the years have stalled in Nigeria’s National Assembly, leaving whistleblowers legally vulnerable.\n\nNigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework\n\nOn September 18, 2025, Federal High Court judges and civil society advocates debated on Nigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework at a national interactive forum convened by the African Centre for Media & Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) for federal high court judges, in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city.\n\nHarry Ogwuche, the Director of Economic and Social Rights at Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), shared during the debate:\n\nProtecting whistleblowers is not an abstract anti-corruption strategy; it is a direct, proactive investment in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights as enshrined in Chapter IV of our Constitution and various international covenants Nigeria is party to.\n\nThe role of judges in protecting whistleblowers\n\nWhile seeking the support of judges in the advocacy for a whistleblower protection law in Nigeria, Chido Onumah, Coordinator of AFRICMIL, said:\n\nJudges are key actors in any judicial system. Therefore, the forum aims to provide a platform for interaction with judges on whistleblowing, its legal framework, and the critical role they play in ensuring justice for whistleblowers and handling corruption cases effectively.\n\nAt the forum, persecuted whistleblower Yisa Usman shared how he was pressured, intimidated, and sidelined from his profession after blowing the whistle on his company. Usman is a chartered accountant who worked in the finance and accounts department, but after exposing corruption, he was redeployed to the ICT department, transferred to different states, and subsequently fired. He said:\n\nBecause I decided to speak up, I am jobless. I was ostracized and frustrated to accept the norm. To remain silent is to be complicit. To achieve results as a whistleblower, it is important to be familiar with the laws because if you know the laws that guide and protect you, you will be able to challenge them. Despite several attempts to detain me, I am walking free because of the judiciary.\n\nExisting and pending laws to protect whistleblowers\n\nNigeria’s Constitution and several statutes already contain protections that could be extended to whistleblowers. These include: Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. Section 6(4)(c) of the National Human Rights Commission Act prohibits harassment of individuals who cooperate with the Commission. Anti-corruption laws like the EFCC Act and ICPC Act provide limited safeguards. The Freedom of Information Act protects disclosures made in good faith.\n\nIn practice, these fragmented provisions are inconsistently applied, and without a unified protection law, whistleblowers continue to face retaliation.\n\nNigeria’s situation contrasts sharply with that of its regional neighbors. Ghana’s Whistleblower Act (Act 720) and South Africa’s Protected Disclosures Act provide dedicated mechanisms.\n\nVladimir Radomirović, a Serbian journalist and co-founder of Pištaljka, an organization based in Belgrade that provides free legal aid and protection to whistleblowers, shared his experiences of building alliances with the judiciary to strengthen whistleblower protection in Serbia. He said:\n\nThe judges have a very influential role in protecting whistleblowers in Serbia, and we try to work with judges and allow them to hear from whistleblowers about how they are retaliated against for protecting the public interest.\n\nAFRICMIL and its partners urged the Nigerian legislature to urgently enact the whistleblower protection law, one that guarantees anonymity, provides penalties against retaliation, and establishes an independent body to oversee cases.\n\nWhistleblowers and civil society organizations appealed to judges to embrace a proactive role in safeguarding whistleblowers. They called for progressive adjudication that interprets existing laws in the spirit of transparency and protection for defenders; expedited hearings to ensure justice is not delayed and therefore denied; the awarding of exemplary damages against retaliators to serve as a deterrent; and above all, the protection of anonymity in court procedures. These recommendations, they argued, are vital if the judiciary is to strengthen trust, uphold justice, and ensure that whistleblowing truly serves as a tool for accountability in Nigeria.",

    "title": "Nepal’s Khoj Samachar challenges corruption and empowers youth through digital media",
    "text": "There are nearly 4,900 registered print media outlets in Nepal. Around eighteen news outlets operate exclusively online through digital platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. By law, online media must register with Nepal’s Department of Information and Broadcasting; however, not all outlets currently comply with this requirement.\n\nStanding out among these registered outlets is Khoj Samachar, an independent digital media platform that raises awareness among young people, challenges corruption, and amplifies underrepresented voices in Nepal. Its founder, Roshan Shrestha, is an investigative journalist from Nepal. His approach relies on digital platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and a dedicated app to draw public attention to marginalized stories and pressure authorities to take action. The platform publishes content in Nepali, in both text and video formats.\n\nAbdulrosheed Fadipe of Global Voices interviewed Roshan via WhatsApp to discuss his journey as an investigative journalist and how he uses digital platforms to promote social change, strengthen good governance, and encourage citizen engagement in Nepal.\n\nGlobal Voices (GV): What inspired you to start Khoj Samachar, and what challenges did you face in building it from scratch?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): I started my journalism journey during my school years at Shree Bachchhala Devi Higher Secondary School, Nagpuje, Sindhupalchok District, in Bagmati Province of Nepal. When I was in class 8, a man who was the presenter at Avenues Television came to my school to teach students about journalism. That training programme planted the seed of journalism in my mind.\n\nMy interest in journalism grew after a devastating earthquake occurred in Nepal in 2015. Although the epicenter of the earthquake was located in Gorkha district, many houses in my village, which is located near the Bhotekoshi River, were destroyed. Many people lost their lives. The Tataponi border crossing with China was also closed. I had just completed class 11 then. I was using a simple Android phone because I was from a low-middle-class family that depended on agriculture for a living. With that phone, I started filming and uploading videos of the earthquake's destruction of villages on a YouTube channel. This was how my journalism career began.\n\nIn 2021, I officially launched Khoj Samachar. I did not receive any financial support when I started nor did I have a big team. Now we have a team of four individuals broadcasting news in both English and Nepali.\n\nGV: How do you maintain editorial independence and ensure your outlet's content remains unbiased and free from external influences?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): We do not take money, favors, or support from any political party, business group, or outside donor. From day one, Khoj Samachar has survived only through the income we earn from Facebook and YouTube ads. With those limited earnings, we pay our team and run the entire platform. This is not always easy, but it gives us full freedom. Nobody can tell us what to say or what to hide. We can question leaders, expose corruption, and speak for the people without fear of losing sponsors or upsetting funders. Our only loyalty is to our readers and viewers. For us, independence is more valuable than comfort. Even if the road is difficult, we choose truth over compromise — that is why our content remains unbiased and trusted.\n\nGV: How do you prioritize stories that amplify underrepresented media voices, and what impact do you hope these stories have on your audience?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): At Khoj Samachar, we always give priority to the voices that big media often ignores — farmers, workers, rural youth, and ordinary citizens who face injustice. Many times, people from villages directly contact us to share their pain, because they feel unheard elsewhere.\n\nWe have highlighted stories like that of a person struggling to get a bridge built in his village, a road left unfinished for 10 years, or a family trapped in hardship without support. By showing these issues through videos, we try to bring public attention and pressure the authorities to act.\n\nOur hope is that by giving a platform to these underrepresented voices, young people will feel more connected, more aware, and inspired to raise their own voices. We want our audience to see that journalism is not only about leaders and cities, but also about the real struggles of common people — and that truth can bring real change.\n\nGV: What strategies do you use to reach audiences beyond capital cities, and how do you measure the impact of your reporting in these areas?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): From the beginning, our focus was not only on Kathmandu but also on rural and remote areas. We create stories that reflect the real problems of villages — like missing bridges in Humla, neglected roads in Dailekh, or migrant workers’ struggles. Many of these issues are sent to us directly by local people through phone calls, Facebook messages, or our app. By turning their voices into reports and videos, we make sure their problems are heard nationally.\n\nTo measure impact, we look at the response from citizens and authorities. For example, in Saudi Arabia, when stranded workers contacted us, our coverage led to parliamentary debates and direct government action. Similarly, when we cover local problems, we monitor community feedback in comments, shares, and messages, and also check if the government or local representatives respond. For us, the real impact is when ordinary people feel their voices are finally heard and some positive change begins.\n\nGV: What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced as an independent journalist, and how have you overcome them?\n\nRS: There have been many difficult moments in my journey, but the most painful ones came when some people, who are unable to accept the truth, started abusing my family and even threatened physical attacks in public. As a journalist, I can tolerate criticism and risk, but when my family is dragged into controversy for my work, it is truly unbearable.\n\nSpeaking the truth, especially against corruption and powerful figures, always brings political pressure. Many tried to silence us or scare us into stopping, but journalism loses its meaning if we compromise with fear. What keeps me going is the trust and support of the public and the inner courage to always speak the truth. The emotional burden is heavy, but I continue because ordinary people rely on us to be their voice, and that responsibility gives me the strength to move forward.\n\nGV: How do you envision the future of Khoj Samachar, and what steps are you taking to ensure its sustainability and continued impact?\n\nRS: My main goal is to build Khoj Samachar as a platform based only on truth and facts, not dependent on external funding or political power. The message I want to pass to youth is that they can succeed in journalism by standing for the truth, even if they are alone. I am working to add more features to the Roshan Shrestha App so that it will be useful for the public. This step will help us sustain our work, expand our impact, and keep serving society with independent journalism.\n\nGV: Why did you name the Roshan Shrestha App after yourself?\n\nRS: By putting my own name on the app, I wanted to assure users that this platform is genuine, transparent, and trustworthy. It is not for self-promotion but rather a matter of responsibility: if my name is attached, people know they can rely on it.",

But sharp cuts to foreign aid by a number of governments are shrinking the available funds for nonprofits, with digital rights organizations like ours taking a particular hit.\n\nAnd it’s a hard time for news and translation organizations right now, with new technologies being used to cut staff and mass-produced disinformation crowding out quality news. Even in this challenging time, Global Voices’ production and readership have been going up, but since we are committed to never paywalling and not showing ads, that doesn’t translate into covering our running costs unless readers donate.\n\nGlobal Voices is a relatively low-cost organization to run: we have no office, no rent, and few physical supplies. We pay for the servers that host our site and a few other administrative costs, but by far the majority of our expenses are for paying our staff. Many grants don’t want to fund more than a small percentage of personnel costs, because they want to pay directly for activities, but personnel costs are the basis of all our activities. Our staff and our volunteers research stories, write and edit, translate and advocate — and sometimes they also do graphic design or photo choice, social media promotion, and more. That is who we’re trying to support with the funds from this campaign — our community, the people who make the articles and essays, translations, research reports, and podcasts that you find on our site.\n\nIf we had a dollar for every page view of the site, we wouldn't need to do a campaign! And if each of those dollars were a monthly commitment, we’d be able to plan ahead for longer-term activities and be generally less stressed. But we know that not everyone can contribute for lots of different reasons, so instead we can think about it as five dollars from one-fifth of the monthly site visits, or ten dollars from one-tenth, and maybe someone who hasn't read anything this month but believes in what we do kicks in twenty-five bucks, and someone else who loves translations sends another fifteen and… you get the idea.\n\nWe hope that you can be one of those contributors, and if you can’t right now, we hope you still come and spend time on our site, and then tell other people about it. Even more than a news site, Global Voices is a community, and we’d like you to be a part of it.

    "title": "The paradox of women’s rights in Peru",
    "text": "By Grecia Flores Hinostroza\n\nIn Peru, women’s rights exist in a strange paradox: on paper, we have the laws, the representation, and the international commitments that promise equality; in reality, our lives tell a different story. Political progress coexists alongside persistent neglect, with numbers that flatter and figures that fail. This contradiction is not hidden in the shadows — the painful contrast is written plainly in the numbers we so proudly display.\n\nAccording to the SDG Gender Index, Peru scores 72.9 for “Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments,” a figure that suggests progress, visibility, and leadership. And yet, when we shift our gaze to health, the score drastically drops to 35.5, barely half. Women are present in Congress, but absent from the healthcare system that should protect them.\n\nIf political participation alone were enough, our streets would be safer, our hospitals accessible, and our voices heard beyond the voting booth. But in Peru, as in much of Latin America, representation has not broken the chains of inequality — it has simply made them less visible to those who govern.\n\nThe data tells one story. The lives of rural, Indigenous, and poor women tell another — one where access to basic sexual and reproductive health services is a distant reality. Where hospitals, experts, and care are unreachable. As the political scientist Stéphanie Rousseau notes in “The Politics of Reproductive Health in Peru,” “Although health sector reforms have had some positive impact on women’s reproductive health, the many restrictions placed on women’s right to reproductive choices have blocked further progress.”\n\nThe consequences are not abstract. In 2020, Peru’s maternal mortality ratio stood at 69 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the World Health Organization, far above the Latin American average of 45 and nearly five times that of Chile (16) and Uruguay (13). These numbers represent women whose lives could have been saved by timely care, safe births and the fulfilment of rights already recognized by law.\n\nBut these injustices are not only moral failures; they are legal betrayals. Peru has signed its name beneath international promises: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and others. These are not distant treaties gathering dust in diplomatic archives. They are binding commitments, written to safeguard the dignity, health, and safety of women — commitments meant to reach every hospital room, courtroom, and remote village in our country.\n\nLaws protecting sexual and reproductive health rights exist on paper, but they remain distant from the realities of rural, Indigenous, and poor women. Clinics lack essential services. Comprehensive reproductive care is unavailable. Legal frameworks declare equality, but equality disappears in places where women still face forced pregnancies, unsafe births, and systemic neglect.\n\nThe Constitution speaks of equality, but equality does not walk the roads where women carry their pregnancies alone. The Ministry of Health issues protocols, but those protocols do not save lives when the nearest health centre is closed, or when the only doctor is gone. Rights without access are hollow. Commitments without implementation are betrayal.\n\nIn this context, political representation must not be mistaken for liberation. We cannot accept the illusion of progress that comes from more women in office if it is not matched by concrete action to dismantle structural barriers. Empowerment is not an empty slogan — it is the lived reality without fear, accessing healthcare without barriers, and raising one’s voice without retaliation.\n\nThe gap between law and life is not an abstract policy flaw; it is a daily crisis. It is the young girl in a rural province forced to give birth after sexual assault because abortion is inaccessible. It is the mother who dies on the way to a hospital that never has the capacity to treat her. Likewise, it is the Indigenous community where reproductive rights exist only in the language of faraway courts, not in the practice of local healthy systems.\n\nIf we measure success only by the presence of women in power, we ignore the absence of justice in their communities. Numbers in parliament cannot compensate for empty maternity wards. International recognition cannot replace the right to safe childbirth.\n\nI call on the Peruvian Congress to legislate not for appearances, but for autonomy. To ensure that health, safety, and dignity are realities in every province. I call on international donors to fund the fight for reproductive freedom, not just political participation. And I call on Peruvian society to recognize that representation without rights is no victory at all.\n\nRepresentation matters. But it is only the beginning. Real empowerment is when every woman controls her future — her body, her health, her voice — regardless of where she was born or how far she lives from the capital. Until the day, the paradox will remain, and progress will be a promise half-kept.",

    "title": "Pro-government campaign against student protests attempts to justify repression in Serbia",
    "text": "This analysis by Nataša Stanojević was originally published by the International and Security Affairs Centre (ISAC), part of the regional initiative Western Balkans Anti-Disinformation Hub. An edited version is republished by Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nThe protest held on June 28 this year in Belgrade, on the Serbian national and religious holiday, Vidovdan, represented the culmination of months of public discontent with government policies and systemic societal problems.\n\nVidovdan is deeply rooted in national history and collective memory and has often been used as a symbol of political and moral struggle. In this case, students and other citizens chose the date to underscore the seriousness of their demands for responsible governance, to call for snap elections, and advocate for essential institutional reforms.\n\nAccording to estimates, the protest gathered around 140,000 people, making it one of the largest political gatherings in the past decade. The sheer size of the turnout reflects profound social frustration and a sense that institutional mechanisms for expressing discontent have completely failed. However, while the organizers’ demands were clearly defined — fighting corruption, institutional accountability, and democratization of the system — pro-government media constructed an entirely different picture.\n\nInstead of fact-based reporting, the public sphere was flooded with sensationalist headlines and claims aimed at delegitimizing the protests and criminalizing participants. The student movement and citizens were not portrayed as advocates of democratic values, but as a threat to the stability of the state. This strategy of criminalization, typical of authoritarian regimes, allowed the authorities to justify the use of force and intensified repression.\n\nPro-government media in Serbia systematically employ false and manipulative narratives to discredit legitimate civic protests and normalize the state’s repressive responses. Analysis shows that key propaganda tactics include labeling participants, manipulating events, constructing an image of a foreign enemy, and glorifying police force. These practices have long-term consequences for democratic processes and freedom of expression.\n\nInstruments of the propaganda narrative\n\nOne of the most commonly used strategies was the deployment of pejorative labels. Organizers and participants were not referred to as students or citizens but as “blockaders,” “hooligans,” and “terrorists.”\n\nA headline in the tabloid newspaper Informer, “Anti-hooligan operation in the city center: Watch how blockaders are arrested,” illustrates how police intervention was presented as necessary and legitimate, while citizens were criminalized. The term “terrorists” carries particularly strong connotations, suggesting extremism, even though the protests were peaceful in nature.\n\nMedia outlets widely circulated narratives about an alleged “hellish plan” by demonstrators. Headlines such as “Bridges and the entire city under siege: The new hellish plan of blockader terrorists, they want blood and dead bodies on the streets!” create an atmosphere of fear and suggest inevitable escalation into violence. These unfounded claims serve to mobilize the government’s loyal voter base and legitimize repressive measures. Rhetoric about “blood on the streets” and “danger to citizens” not only criminalizes protest participants but also frames them as a national security threat.\n\nPro-government discourse attributed goals to the protesters, such as “destroying the state” and “overthrowing the president.” These claims are not based on any documents or public statements by organizers, whose demands focused on improving safety, fighting corruption, and ensuring political accountability. Introducing accusations of “treason” and “collaboration with enemies” is part of a broader model of political propaganda in which social resistance is portrayed as a conspiracy against national interests.\n\nWhile pro-government media insisted on an image of violent demonstrations, actual events tell a different story. According to reports from independent media and human rights organizations, the majority of the protest was peaceful. This was also confirmed by the Council of Europe.\n\nThe few incidents that occurred happened only after police intervention, during which excessive force was used. The arrests or detentions of hundreds of people, along with documented cases of physical abuse, clearly show that state repression was the dominant dynamic. This gap between the media narrative and empirical facts is a classic example of the framing technique — selective presentation of reality to shape public opinion.\n\nThe broader political context and the foreign enemy narrative\n\nParticularly concerning is the strategy of linking the protests to alleged foreign enemies, in this case, Croatia. Certain tabloids and politicians suggested that the organizers of the protests were instruments in the hands of Croatian intelligence structures and that their goal was the destabilization of Serbia. These claims have no factual basis, but serve a clear propaganda purpose: to evoke historical tensions and use national stereotypes to create a sense of threat among citizens. (The hostilities between Serbia and Croatia have deep roots in their national narratives. These tensions began during the Ottoman Empire when many Serbian refugees were settled in Croatia by the Austrian authorities. The animosity intensified during World War II when Croatia joined the Axis powers, and was solidified during the wars that accompanied Yugoslavia’s breakup. This period culminated in Operation Storm, which resulted in the majority of Serbs fleeing Croatia.)\n\nThe use of Croatia in this narrative has a dual function: first, to mobilize patriotic sentiment; by suggesting that the protests are connected to a “hostile state,” the government reinforces its image as the defender of national interests. Second, it discredits the opposition and civic initiatives; by attributing “foreign influence” to the protests, the government delegitimizes their goals and diverts attention from internal problems such as corruption and institutional breakdown. This rhetoric relies on the well-known model of “constructing a foreign enemy,” which, according to political communication theory, serves to homogenize the electorate and justify authoritarian practices.\n\nA particularly alarming segment of the propaganda campaign concerns the linkage of protests with the issue of Srebrenica. (The 1995 massacre of the Muslim population in Srebrenica and its surrounding areas by the Army of Republika Srpska is frequently exploited by both nationalist and anti-Western factions in Serbia. Similar to narratives that deny the Holocaust, discussions about Srebrenica range from complete denial to unsettling debates about the number of victims, their nationality, and the use of terms like “necessary military action” and “collateral damage.” Over the past 15 years, anyone who does not support these narratives has been labeled a “traitor” or a “Western agent” in official political discourse.)\n\nIn an Informer article entitled “They’ve exposed themselves! This is blockader politics: Accusing Serbia of a nonexistent genocide in Srebrenica,” students were accused of “agreeing with accusations that brand Serbs as a genocidal nation.” This narrative attempts to shift the focus from demands for democratization to a national question, creating the impression that the protests have an “anti-Serbian agenda.” In this way, civic resistance is criminalized through manipulation of one of the most emotionally charged issues in the public sphere.\n\nA similar rhetoric is used by the portal Vaseljenska in the article “Blockaders want to declare Serbs a genocidal nation: Elections, then a government that will recognize the genocide in Srebrenica.” These claims are absent from any official demands of the organizers, but their function is clear: to discredit the protests by linking them with alleged plans to “betray national interests.” Thus, the government constructs a narrative in which students are not only “hooligans” but also agents of dangerous ideological and political projects.\n\nNarrative vs objective facts\n\nIn the long term, such practices lead to the consolidation of authoritarian patterns of governance. When every criticism of regime representatives is labeled as “treason” or “terrorism,” the space for democratic dialogue disappears. This not only delegitimizes protests but also undermines the fundamental values on which modern democratic societies rest.\n\nThis analysis of the media narrative surrounding the Vidovdan protests demonstrates that pro-government media act as a propaganda apparatus whose primary function is the preservation of political power, not informing the public. Through the dissemination of a distorted perception of civic resistance, the construction of violent scenarios, and the invention of foreign enemies, the authorities succeed in delegitimizing valid social demands and justifying repressive measures. Such a strategy may stabilize the regime in the short term, but in the long run, it erodes the foundations of democracy and leads to further political and social crises.",

    "title": "‘It is hard to feel neutral’: How Nepal's media covered the Gen Z uprising",
    "text": "This Dart Centre Asia Pacific Report by Arun Karki was originally published in Nepali Times, and an edited version has been republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.\n\nWhat should a journalist do when young protesters are shot in front of her? Does she do her job and stay neutral? Can you stay neutral?\n\nAs Gen Z protests engulfed Kathmandu, Nepal's journalists found themselves reporting a story that was personal. While doing their job, some of them were even targeted by mobs.\n\nRead More: Gen Z stands up to expose corruption in Nepal\n\nDart Asia Pacific Fellow Arun Karki visited their newsrooms and spoke with his colleagues about their experience of reporting the Gen Z protests that erupted on September 8th. These are the first-hand accounts of journalists who witnessed the turmoil in the city they call home.\n\nSunita Karki was at a workshop in a hotel on September 8th. She saw the first waves of protests through hotel windows. Curfew alerts flooded her phone, a vehicle belonging to a human rights group sat burning across the road, young boys were taking their wounded friends on motorbikes to local hospitals, and police were beating a teenager with their hands raised.\n\n“I cried a lot,” she said, but the tears were not out of fear — they were because she felt guilt. “I couldn’t write the news. We were witnessing these scenes from a five-star hotel.” By evening, the death toll had reached 19. On September 9th at about 3:35 pm, her outlet, the Annapurna Post's office in Tinkune, Kathmandu, was set on fire. Staff had to leave the building as parts of the newsroom burned down.\n\nWhen she knew her office was burning, she anxiously told her husband that she would resign from the job: “If we have to hide our identification cards in every protest, what kind of journalist am I?” she asked herself.\n\nShe filed a story the next day, but her emotions kept bouncing between those of a journalist bound to duty and a civilian in shock. She said that in moments like this, it’s hard to feel truly neutral.\n\nAfter watching the police beat people, she felt a strong urge to step in, not just stand back and report. The first real calm came later, when people came to the street and lit candles together in honor of those who were killed. “This was a sort of victory procession. I felt some relief after brutal days,” she said.\n\nAngad Dhakal a photojournalist who works at Kantipur National Daily, was standing outside his office building when protesters stormed in and set parts of it on fire. He had already been informed that protesters were planning to torch his office building and rushed to his office hoping to save his hard drives containing ten years of photography work. He failed.\n\nHe raised his camera and “forcefully” pressed the shutter — more to document the scene than out of “professional enthusiasm or duty.”\n\n“My office was burning. What should I photograph?” he recalled. A few moments later, a protester noticed the “PHOTO” label on his yellow Press jacket. Dhakal deflected it by saying he was an early-career freelancer and YouTuber. He went into a corner and took his jacket off so that protesters wouldn't target him.\n\nWhen it comes to covering street protests, Angad usually stands near the police because it feels safer. But on September 8th, fire and gunshots made even that area unsafe. A rubber bullet hit his friend Dipendra Dhungana, badly injuring him.\n\nHe thought, “Where do we go now? If we stay here, we’ll be hit.” After witnessing two days of protests, violence, and killings, and seeing his own office burning, he couldn't sleep for days.\n\nThe same afternoon that government buildings burned and media outlet Kantipur was attacked, a message in a protest Discord forum talked openly of “attacking Kantipur.”\n\nRumors spread to other outlets. Outside OnlineKhabar's office, where Gaurav Pokharel works, the newsroom manager said, “Very suspicious people were walking around.” They lowered blinds, avoided windows, locked the front gate, and dispersed staff to other places across the city. The outlet was threatened and effectively locked down, but not torched.\n\nPokharel hid his press ID. “ I never showed the ID card. Sometimes I had to enter the crowd shouting slogans, just to blend in among the protesters,” he said. He watched people fall under gunfire, and he helped pull one surrounded journalist out of a hostile crowd.\n\nGaurav also contributed articles to international outlets as a freelancer. Later, while transcribing an interview of a young protest organizer, he wrote to his editor at an international outlet: “This was very hard to write. I cried many times while doing it.” He had been working at a stretch for days, battling bouts of exhaustion and low blood pressure.\n\nProtesters vandalized and set fire within the Singha Darbar complex housing Nepal Television and Radio Nepal. They tried to disrupt public broadcasting.\n\nSurendra Paudyal began the day with his press ID hanging on his neck, thinking it would let him move freely. But when he reached Singha Darbar around 3:30 pm, the situation felt dangerous.\n\nHe put the ID in his pocket. When asked what mattered most, he answered without pause: life comes first. In that moment, he felt real fear and a strong duty to protect his team.\n\nHis focus narrowed to basic things: stay calm, find exits, get everyone out safely. Later, they were able to keep the 8 pm news on air through a regional link. He felt mixed emotions and a sense of relief that the broadcast continued, but also sadness and anger that their own studio had come under attack.",

    "title": "The great silence surrounding marital rape in Senegal",
    "text": "By Bowel Diop\n\nGender-based violence, including marital rape, occurs worldwide, and often, the perpetrators are the victim's husband. Marital rape is defined as an act in which one partner forces the other to engage in non-consensual sex. A report by Equality, a US-based organisation with offices in New York, Nairobi, and London, reveals that many women are affected by this phenomenon, including many in Africa.\n\nIn private online forums where women post under anonymity, distressing testimonies emerge about the violence they suffer within relationships. Out of respect and for the protection of those sharing their stories, no names or platform details are revealed. Behind these testimonies emerges a chilling reality: that of sexual relations imposed within marriage without the woman’s consent, in other words, the reality of marital rape.\n\nAs violence against women becomes increasingly common, consent is being trampled. The notion of “conjugal duty” still frequently outweighs a woman’s right to make decisions about her body.\n\nIt is in these digital spaces, where distress is voiced and violence normalized, that discussion groups take shape, embodying a form of digital sisterhood. Providing room for listening, support, and open speech, these spaces enable women to challenge together the taboos that restrict their empowerment, online as well as offline. This safe space where women share their experiences underlines the urgency of an open and courageous debate on marital rape in Africa.\n\nA cultural, religious, and legal debate\n\nIn May 2025, the program “Midi Plus” on TFM Télévision Futur Média, based in Senegal, gave national exposure to Oustaz Modou Fall, a Muslim authority in the country. This preacher claims that conjugal duty takes precedence over consent, thereby legitimizing sexual violence in the name of marriage. Speaking in Wolof, he stated:\n\nGnouni loi bi néna sakh sa diabar so beugué teud akk mom té dacoroul daga ko violé . Pfff wakhi dof ! Sa diabar ga takk ko so farata Yallah akk souna Seydouna Mohamed , touki Pape Samba dem tournage soneu baye beugu dé gnibissi beugu teud ak sokhname gnouniko bouné dama soneu damadone fobéré (rires) ga forcéko viol le. Boudé lou amm la , lane moye texte bi. Si diné.\n\nPeople say the law declares that if you force your wife to have sex, that counts as rape. Pfff — absurd, this is your wife, the one you married before God. You travel, you work, Pape Samba [the host], you come back exhausted, you want to be with your wife, and she refuses. She says she’s tired, that she was doing the housework (laughter). So if you insist, it’s rape? If that’s the case, which religious scripture says so? We must be cautious about this.\n\nThe broadcast immediately sparked indignation across social media. On TikTok, activists and legal experts mobilized. The Xam Sa Droit page published a series of videos challenging Modou Fall’s statements against existing legislation. Specifically, it points to Article 320 of Senegal’s Penal Code, which defines rape as any act of penetration “carried out through violence, coercion, threat or surprise.” This is a reminder that marriage does not take away any fundamental rights, and that refusing sex, even within a couple, remains an inalienable right. This effort at legal education was met with strong support on TikTok, as it put consent back at the center of the discussion.\n\nVoices were also raised on X. Nabou Diop Lo, a lawyer and activist for women’s and children’s rights, posted:\n\nLe viol tel que définit dans le code pénal Sénégalais ne fait pas une distinction entre le viol commis dans le ménage et celui commis hors des liens conjugaux. Tout ce qui compte c'est le consentement de la victime. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nRape, as defined in the Senegalese Penal Code, makes no distinction between rape committed within marriage and that committed outside it. What matters is the victim’s consent. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nBut how can a woman dare complain she's been raped when a religious figure claims that a wife’s “no” carries no weight? This dissonance between the law, public discourse, and women’s lived reality highlights the urgent need for legal reform and a clear stance from the authorities.\n\nBy normalizing marital rape, this official rhetoric entrenches an absolute claim over women’s bodies and heavily compounds the moral weight borne by potential victims.\n\nEquality Now’s 2024 report shows that the legal recognition of marital rape differs significantly across Africa. The report notes that countries such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Madagascar, Senegal, and Togo explicitly criminalize marital rape.\n\nIn countries including Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Tanzania, spouses are explicitly exempted from prosecution, except in exceptional cases.\n\nIn Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mali, Uganda, and Chad, the law remains silent on the matter, creating a complete legal void.\n\nSenegalese law on rape and paedophilia, revised in 2020, sets out the definition of rape as follows:\n\nTout acte de pénétration « commis par violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise ».\n\nAny act of penetration ‘committed by violence, coercion, threat, or surprise.’\n\nHowever, the lack of clear legal provisions on marital rape and spousal consent creates a wide scope for interpretation, often to the detriment of the victim. As a result, marital rape is often treated as an ordinary form of domestic violence, rather than classified as a criminal offence.\n\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, for example, an investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde published in February 2024 reported that a humorous TikTok video mocking women’s sexual fatigue sparked amused reactions — evidence that sexual non-consent is not taken seriously.\n\nAccording to figures published in African Health Sciences, 33 percent of women in Africa have been subjected to sexual violence at some point in their lives, with rates rising to 44 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Côte d’Ivoire, 40 percent of women housed in the shelter run by the NGO Akwaba Mousso say they have suffered marital rape.\n\nIn many African legal systems, including in Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, the implicit presumption of consent between spouses prevents marital rape from being effectively recognised as a crime.\n\nWhen feminists raise awareness on the subject, the issue is frequently minimised. In the previously mentioned Le Monde article, Ivorian activist Marie-Paule Okri, co-founder of the Ivorian League for Women’s Rights, told the journalist:\n\nQuand on essaie d’en parler, on nous répond qu’on exagère. On nous inculque depuis l’adolescence que le corps de la femme est fait pour donner du plaisir à l’homme.\n\nWhen we try to talk about it, we are told we are exaggerating. From adolescence, we are taught that a woman’s body exists to give pleasure to men.\n\nYet Article 14 of the Maputo Protocol commits African states to guaranteeing women’s fundamental rights, including health and reproductive consent.\n\nBeyond legislation, it will take a deep change in attitudes to improve women’s condition, grounded in respect for their bodies and equality in relationships.",

    "title": "A region on the brink: The global implications of the war on Gaza · Global Voices",
    "text": "On October 7, 2023, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), the group that governs the Palestinian territory of Gaza, breached the barrier that has surrounded the densely populated area for the last 16 years, preventing the free flow of people and goods. The militants then launched an attack on 22 nearby Israeli settlements, towns, and military bases, killing around 1,200 civilians and soldiers and taking at least 199 hostages.\n\nMany governments around the world have condemned the attack as a war crime and act of terror, while other governments blamed Israel for setting the stage for these attacks to take place. Since then, many governments have described Israel’s response as disproportionate: the official death toll now exceeds 40,000 Palestinians killed, including over 15,000 children — some experts estimate the actual number to be over four times higher.\n\nFor more, read Global Voices’ previous Special Coverage: Israel’s war on Gaza\n\nThe assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas Political Bureau, in Tehran on 31 July 2024, and a key Hezbollah military commander in Beirut on 30 July have significantly escalated tensions in the region. These targeted killings, combined with the failure to implement a ceasefire, are raising the risk of a war that could engulf the whole region, with potentially far-reaching consequences for global peace and stability.\n\nIsrael’s actions, including its military occupation, settlement expansion, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and recurrent operations in Gaza and the West Bank, have drawn widespread accusations of human rights violations and defiance of international law. This includes an International Court of Justice (ICJ) initial ruling on an ongoing case finding it plausible that Israel is committing genocide and an application by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for arrest warrants against three Hamas leaders — including Haniyeh — and two Israeli officials — including Prime Minister Netanyahu — for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe arrest warrants include one for Mohammed Deif, Commander-in-Chief of Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. the Israeli army claims to have assassinated Deif in an airstrike on July 13 in the Al Mawasi humanitarian safe zone in Gaza — one that killed at least 90 people in a massacre described by United Nations official Scott Anderson as “some of the most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.”\n\nIsrael's military operations and targeted assassinations in neighboring countries continue despite United Nations Security Council resolutions, global calls for a ceasefire, and repeated condemnations from international humanitarian organizations who have labeled them as violations of international humanitarian law. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached catastrophic levels, with an illegal blockade that has led to severe shortages of vital supplies and the threat of a poliovirus outbreak, exacerbating the suffering of the population, with nine out of 10 people internally displaced, many of them multiple times.\n\nThe international community’s failure to enforce a ceasefire or hold Israel accountable has highlighted the limitations of global institutions in managing the crises. The United Nations has failed to mediate effectively, with its resolutions ignored, and global and regional players have not put pressure on Israel to accept or implement ceasefire resolutions adopted by the UNSC or proposed by mediators. This raises significant questions about the effectiveness of international law in protecting civilians in conflict zones.\n\nIn this special coverage, we explore the regional and global implications as well as the challenges facing international law in addressing the ongoing crisis.",

    "title": "How one community in Trinidad & Tobago pushed the culinary boundaries of pigeon peas",
    "text": "By Natalie Briggs\n\nWhen I first met Florence Warrick-Joseph, there were two things I didn’t know. One, we were related in that pumpkin vine way only Caribbean people can be. Two, the doubles I had just bought from her at a pop-up market had a surprise in them.\n\nIt wasn’t the comforting warmth of a bara hot out of the box, leaking through greaseproof paper. It wasn’t the silken tear of teeth into that just-fried pillowy goodness, which, if you’re lucky, will still hold a hint of the crackle of oil.\n\nNo, it wasn’t that.\n\nIt was the filling. Cucumber, check. Sweet sauce, check. The heady bouquet of garlic, cumin and spices was there. But there was something different in the mouth feel. It wasn’t the melt-in-your-mouth consistency of the channa that makes doubles a national byword in Trinidad and Tobago. Tasty, yes … but different.\n\nThe same bouquet is heavy in Warrick-Joseph’s small kitchen, tickling the nostrils, making me think about the last time I ate. “I don’t curry the peas. I stew it,” she revealed, while demonstrating how she puts her spin on the popular street food. This is not her only departure from the norm. The peas she uses? They are pigeon peas.\n\nThese days, it isn’t quite the record scratch moment it was when it first appeared — but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. What we should be discussing is how pigeon peas, the stuff of pelau and coconut milk stew-downs, ended up in doubles. It started as an exhortation to think outside the box.\n\nIn 2014, Warrick-Joseph, a retired registered nurse, decided to do an event management course. Her lecturer asked the cohort to stretch themselves beyond the ho-hummery of birthday parties and christenings for their practicum. She was an avid planter of pigeon peas, one of the many members of the Upper Cemetery Street Residents’ Association in Diego Martin, to do so. They had a bumper crop that year.\n\n“We were walking back down the hill,” Warrick-Joseph recalled. “Me, Errol [her husband] and Mr. Timothy. And he asked what were we going to do with all these peas. My husband said, ‘We will freeze it, we will sell it.’ Because that is what people do to get money to put in the organisation. So I said, thinking out of the box, we could have a pigeon peas festival.”\n\nThe two men were sceptical. Warrick-Joseph continued, “They were like, ‘Nobody ever heard of a pigeon peas festival.’ I said, ‘I’ve heard of a mango festival. I’ve heard of a breadfruit festival. There’s a chocolate festival. Why not pigeon peas?’”\n\nThe stage was set, but the main players were yet to arrive. They had the peas, but it would literally take a village to showcase their versatility. By the time the first festival rolled around in 2015, it was a result of a true community effort. They were able to generate so many recipes, including a version of doubles, that there were enough to fill a commemorative book.\n\n“We got someone to do pholourie,” Warrick-Joseph said. “We got somebody who could do pigeon peas accra. Everybody ended up taking a recipe. We found people in the community who could do these things. The pigeon peas roti was from a woman who did roti, and instead of using the dhal with the split peas, she used the pigeon peas.”\n\nPholourie? Accra? Roti? It wasn’t such a stretch of the imagination. After all, pigeon peas’ nutty, earthy flavour lends itself well to a variety of savoury preparations. That’s why it’s a perennial favourite across the Caribbean.\n\nBut Warrick-Joseph was about to hit me another curveball. That first festival, she came up with four of her own recipes. One for ice cream. One for a punch. One for a pigeon peas wine. Then one for a liqueur. Two of those are sweet. One of them officially qualifies as dessert. The trick was in picking, shelling and stewing the fresh pigeon peas to form the custard base all within 24 hours, while they were still full of flavour. My mind had more difficulty wrapping around the idea of pigeon peas as this creamy, cold concoction.\n\nThere were no such problems with the muffins. As I stood and watched her prepare them, different scents filled the kitchen, this time with her signature spice blend. It was the spice, I realised, that gave it the illusion of being sweet. I hadn’t seen her put a lot of sugar into the mixture. The eventual result was dense, reminding me more of a coconut drop than the traditional muffin with its cakey crumb. Fresh out of the oven, breaking into one was a treat; I could smell the spices wafting up from the steamy centre. There was nutmeg. Some cinnamon, too.\n\nNothing in the flavour screamed pigeon peas. That was more in the texture and the solidity with which it sat in my stomach. One muffin felt like a full meal, which led me to ask about the nutritional benefits of the pigeon peas substitution. I found out that, among other things, they were high in potassium and fibre, and were good for gut flora, diabetics, and women who wanted to lose weight.\n\nIn fact, it was trying to cater to customers who wanted healthier alternatives to doubles that prompted Warrick-Joseph to come up with a recipe for gluten-free bara, made with pigeon pea flour: “The reason for the switch was that people felt they wanted gluten-free. There was a group of people that was intolerant to normal flour.”\n\nThese were what I had really come to see her prepare, the muffins being a delectable side journey. I knew it would be different from the first doubles I had from her, since the bara in that one had been made the regular way, with flour, leavening agent and oil. How different this version would be, both in taste and feel, was left to be seen.\n\nIt was a three-flour mix, including the ground pigeon peas, which resulted in a tacky, sticky sort of dough that was allowed to rest for about half an hour. While it did that, Warrick-Joseph warmed the oil in which she would fry them later, and prepared the pigeon peas filling. We talked about many things while she did this, including her business and her plans to eventually have pre-packaged products in the supermarket.\n\nWhen she deemed the dough ready, she put the peas aside. The low gluten content made it difficult to handle as it tears easily, which is why she prefers to use a pastelle press to shape them, instead of rolling them out the traditional way. From there, the perfect circles went into the warmed oil, where they puff up slightly — nothing like the regular bara, because of the low gluten content. By the time they are done, I’m itching to try them.\n\nWarrick-Joseph presented them to me on a plate, complete with pigeon peas filling, cucumber and a tangy tamarind sweet sauce. I took a bite, and chewed slowly, trying to make up my mind about them. The verdict? All the elements were there. This tasted like doubles. Purists might draw the line at the bara, which was more reminiscent of a soft taco shell — flatter, with a slight, mealy crunch to it — while health enthusiasts might hail it as the thing to make doubles great again.",

    "text": "Exile Hub is one of Global Voices’ partners in Southeast Asia, emerging in response to the 2021 coup in Myanmar, focusing on empowering journalists and human rights defenders. This edited article is republished under a content partnership agreement.\n\nMost people spend their lives running away from danger. Esther ran toward it.\n\nAfter finding refuge in Australia under UNHCR protection, she made the bold decision to return to the Thailand–Myanmar border in 2023 to continue her journalism. Now, in 2025, she reports from one of Myanmar’s most dangerous conflict zones often under fire, often uncertain of tomorrow. Yet she remains unshaken.\n\nIn a world where silence is safe, Esther chooses the frontline. Her weapon is truth, and she wields it for those who cannot.\n\nA journey against the current\n\nBorn in Mon State in 1993, Esther has always been someone who could not ignore injustice.\n\n“I have never been able to lie to myself or live in misery. If something doesn’t sit right with me, I have to face it head-on,” she reflects.\n\nLike many young people in Myanmar, Esther initially wandered through different jobs, unsure of her calling. She translated movies, worked as a travel and tour sales representative, and later became a public relations officer at a Korean company. But none of these roles felt right.\n\n“I couldn’t stay where I felt trapped or compromised,” she shares.\n\nHer turning point came in 2018 when she attended a basic journalism course. “That’s when I realized writing and sharing opinions was what I had always loved. It felt like home.” After the course ended, she landed her first journalism job at an ethnic media house.\n\nWhen the coup changed everything\n\nBy 2021, Esther was working with a major media house. When the coup hit, her newsroom relocated to Karenni State, and Esther went with them, continuing to report under dangerous conditions. But even after escaping to Australia for safety, the pull of truth was stronger than comfort. In 2023, she made the decision to return.\n\nA few months after she arrived in Thailand, the military made a desperate announcement. In February 2024, the military reactivated its conscription law, mandating that men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 serve in the army. Evading service or helping someone evade could lead to five years in prison.\n\n“As the number of these conscription stories grew, so did my determination to report them,” Esther recalls. But working as an exiled independent journalist came with its own struggles. With no regular income and the constant need for resources, continuing her work was a challenge. That’s when she applied for Exile Hub’s Critical Voices Fellowship 2024 and received it.\n\nBearing witness on the frontlines\n\nEsther began collecting stories from those most affected. She spoke with young men who had fled their villages, fearful of being conscripted. She also interviewed women who had watched brothers and husbands taken by the army, leaving families uncertain and anxious about their loved ones’ fate.\n\nIn September 2024, she published “I Don’t Want Others to Face What I Faced: Stories of Forced Military Conscription,” giving a voice to those the regime wanted silenced.\n\nLater, she followed with another hard-hitting piece, “Snatched from Their Beds, Taken on the Streets — The Young Men in Myanmar Forced to Fight the Junta’s Losing War.”\n\nToday, Esther works deep inside one of Myanmar’s most volatile conflict zones, a place where the sound of gunfire and the threat of airstrikes are constant. Despite the risks, she is satisfied with witnessing the truth with her eyes and documenting and reporting on it.\n\nEsther is more than a journalist. She is a lifeline for those whose cries would otherwise vanish in the dark. And no matter the risk, she will keep writing and keep reporting, because for her, silence is never an option.",

    "text": "Environmental groups initiated global activities and protests from September 18 to 21 to drumbeat the call for urgent climate action amid the worsening pollution and continuing deterioration of the natural ecosystem. The series of protests were held right before the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and less than six weeks away from the UN Climate Summit (COP30) in Brazil.\n\nIn Asia, the “Draw the Line” campaign highlighted the demand to phase out fossil fuels, build renewables, shift to sustainable food, and prioritize the people’s basic needs over corporate interests.\n\nSeveral countries participated in the campaign led by a network of environmental groups and community-based organizations.\n\nIn the Philippines, the campaign was actively supported by local groups resisting projects and policies that threaten the lives and livelihoods of rural and coastal communities. A fluvial protest was organized in the town of Culasi in Antique province, located in the Visayas islands of the Philippines, to call attention to the demand of the small fisherfolk against the entry of commercial fishing operations in municipal waters. Javie Barcinal of 350.org Asia echoed the stand of small fishers.\n\nSmall fishers are among the worst affected by the climate crisis, with warming seas resulting in dwindling catches each year. To make matters worse, the government has allowed industrial fishing to encroach into municipal waters. This exacerbates climate injustice that small fishers experience as hunger for their families.\n\nIn Indonesia, environmnetalists organized at least 36 actions in 34 cities and provinces across the country on September 18, to push for bold reforms in government policies. A march was held towards the State Palace on September 19 as rallyists reiterated the anti-corruption demands of the youth-led protests that erupted in the country last month. Sisilia Nurmala Dewi of 350.org Indonesia led climate advocates in asserting an end to corruption to fund a better future.\n\nWe draw the line as flash floods drown the innocent, while people’s voices against government failures are being silenced. Oligarchs and polluters have ruled this country for far too long, taking public money for climate action and destroying natural resources that should be preserved for future generations. We demand real, decisive action. President Prabowo must honor his promises by committing to 100 percent renewable energy in 10 years and a clear immediate plan to phase-out coal plants.\n\nPaskah Toga of Climate Rangers Bali cited the recent flooding disaster in Bali island to rally public opposition against fossil-based power plants.\n\nThe recent deadly floods in Bali is clear evidence that the climate crisis is no longer a distant threat but a reality that needs to be resolved with concrete policies. The government must stop building fossil-based power plants and phase out fossil fuels.\n\nIn Japan, protesters challenged the new leadership to phase out fossil fuels and to reverse policies that blame immigrants for the country’s social woes. Masayoshi Iyoda, 350.org Japan campaigner, summed up their demand.\n\nWe draw the line on Japan’s rising contributions to climate chaos and war. As we experience both flash floods and extreme heat, workers suffer and food prices continue to soar. Japan’s new leadership must show political will to phase out fossil fuels and shift to 100% renewables, instead of going with the far-right tide of blaming immigrants for our economic woes and backsliding on climate action.\n\nThe protest was also attended by activists who expressed solidarity with Palestinians by condemning the continuous bombings and military attacks in Gaza.\n\nIn South Korea, Jiyun Gim of the Green Environment Youth Korea urged authorities to comply with the planned emissions reduction this year.\n\nSouth Korea’s 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) will be determined in November. We are drawing the line to prevent South Korea from setting a climate goal that falls below 60% emissions reduction. This is not just about numbers—it is the survival line for future generations. The government must set ambitious, science-based, and future-oriented climate targets.\n\nIn Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh, community residents staged an action denouncing the planned revival of a coal plant. Shahrukh Karim, a youth leader in Matarbari, articulated the sentiments of the local community.\n\nWe are burning, our lands are dying, and our rivers are drying up. We draw the line on building another coal plant, when the existing one has already driven away thousands of families and turned our homes into a wasteland. This needs to stop.\n\nCommunities Draw the Line on Matarbari Coal Plant 2 Revival https://t.co/2IT1VPkF5P pic.twitter.com/9E05xBK9xV — Energy & Power (@enpbd) September 20, 2025\n\nIn an email interview with Global Voices, 350.org Asia Communications Manager Ilang-Ilang Quijano shared their initial plans on how to sustain the campaign.",

    "title": "Africa charts bold path towards green inclusive development at the second Africa Climate Summit",
    "text": "Over 6,000 delegates gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, for the second Africa Climate Summit (ACS2), held from September 8 to 10, to search for Africa-driven solutions ahead of negotiations for the United Nations 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the world's largest annual environmental conference.\n\nThe second Africa Climate Summit was organized to unite African leaders, youth, and partners in pushing for fair climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s role as a solutions hub, while preparing a common position ahead of COP30 negotiations. It was a pivotal moment for Africa to stake its claim as a leader in the global climate conversation. Leaders, activists, and young innovators came together to push for reforms in climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s youth voices. The gathering was themed around “Accelerating Global Climate Solutions: Financing for Africa’s Resilient and Green Development.” Ethiopia’s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, opened the event with a keynote that set the tone:\n\nAfrica should not be seen only as a victim of climate challenges, but as a continent of solutions and innovations that could guide the world forward.\n\nHe also proposed the “Africa Climate Innovation Compact” to produce 1,000 innovators by 2030, financed and owned by Africans.\n\nThis vision was built on the momentum of the inaugural summit in Nairobi in 2023, which, importantly, was preceded by the African Youth Climate Assembly (AYCA). By doing so, organizers ensured that the majority-youth population of Africa was not just represented but central to shaping the conversation.\n\nThe challenges Africa faces\n\nAfrica continues to wrestle with the painful legacy of historical injustice and the harsh reality of a deepening climate crisis. Despite contributing the least to global emissions, the continent feels the impacts most acutely. Climate finance remains painfully inadequate as wealthy nations have consistently fallen short of their yearly pledge, and African countries today pay back about five times more in debt servicing than they receive in climate aid.\n\nThe cost of this imbalance is causing hospitals to stretch beyond capacity as diseases like malaria and cholera spread more widely under shifting climatic conditions. Crops are failing under the weight of prolonged droughts or sudden floods, leaving farmers with empty fields and families without food. Coastal cities, from Lagos to Dar es Salaam, face rising waters that sweep away homes, businesses, and livelihoods.\n\nYet at the same time, Africa holds some of the richest renewable resources on the planet. If harnessed, its solar capacity alone could power the world many times over. Africa holds 17 percent of the world’s population but receives just 3 percent of global climate investment. Restrictive financial systems and predatory loan arrangements often force African countries back into reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nEcoVista, a youth-led ecological justice movement whose main focus is on climate justice and the environment, based in Nairobi, Kenya posted on its X account:\n\nFossil fuels are the biggest driver of the climate crisis, responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. #MakeThemPay\n\nDraw The Line pic.twitter.com/N9aUDWl8e8 — EcoVistaKe (@EcoVistaKE) September 19, 2025\n\nLayered on top of that is a painful reminder of colonial history. While Africa’s minerals powered industrial growth in the Global North, the continent was left behind with ecological damage and struggling economies. Yearly natural disasters including cyclones, floods, and expanding deserts displace millions every year, and pushed African leaders at ACS2 to adopt the Addis Ababa Declaration, a clear and urgent call for change.\n\nWith regard to the consequences facing Africa, Tangwa Abilu, a Cameroonian Climate and Environmental Activist, shared on X :\n\nThe horn of Africa is grieving because their\n\n-Their farms are no longer yielding\n\n-Advancement of desert is alarming\n\n-Our major rivers are drying\n\n-Proliferation of pest and pathogens\n\n-Development of tropical diseases.\n\n-Our crop are dieing out.\n\nClimate change is a reality. pic.twitter.com/2MQ5fZG1Zo — Tangwa Abilu.🌿🌏🌾🍀🍃.SDG's. (@AbiluTangwa) December 29, 2024\n\nIn the same context, K. Diallo, an African author, drew attention to the damage caused by floods in December 2023. He posted on his X account:\n\nflood disaster in the DR Congo is a result of global warming meeting a failed state…..The global South bears more than 95% of the costs and deaths related to climate change despite making up less than 5% of consumption-based cumulative emissions above 350ppm CO2. pic.twitter.com/vTDobNNVl5 — K.Diallo ☭ (@nyeusi_waasi) December 31, 2023\n\nDemands ahead of COP30\n\nFor African leaders, climate finance must shift from symbolic promises to meaningful reparations. They argue that financing should come as debt-free grants rather than loans that deepen dependency. Historic polluters owe this to frontline communities losing their farms to drought or their homes to rising seas. The Loss and Damage Fund, in particular, needs to prioritize these vulnerable communities with direct, rapid assistance: cash for families in sinking villages, support for starved farmlands, and investment in healthcare for climate-induced trauma. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said:\n\nToo often, Africa's story begins with what we lack: finance, technology, time. Let us instead begin with what we have: the youngest population in the world, vast solar resources, and the resilience to build a new climate economy.\n\nLeaders are also demanding stronger commitments from rich nations. During last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries from the global north pledged to pay USD300 billion in climate finance, but the amount falls far short of the USD1.3 trillion per year needed by African nations, who need it to effectively adapt and transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nACS2 came at a crucial moment when the Lake Chad Basin, which once supported millions across Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic, had shrunk by over 90 percent. With it, the livelihoods of countless families have evaporated. Africa is both the most vulnerable to climate collapse and one of the most promising centers for climate solutions. As the world heads towards COP30 in Brazil in November, Africans say they do not just want to be heard, but are demanding to be recognized as solution builders and shapers of the planet’s shared future.",

    "title": "The legacy of ‘sponge cities’ left by Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian",
    "text": "Yu Kongjian (俞孔坚), 62, the Chinese landscape architect who pioneered the concept of “sponge cities,” died in a plane crash in the Pantanal region, the largest tropical wetland in the world, in Brazil, on September 23, 2025. Three other people also died during the accident: pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, and filmmakers Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., who were both working with Yu to create a documentary about sponge cities. The cause of the crash is under investigation.\n\nFerraz’s work focused on nonfiction productions, including a series about the 2016 plane crash involving the Brazilian football team, Chapecoense. Crispim Jr. worked on projects such as a documentary about Brazilian architect Vilanova Artigas and another about the first women’s football national team in Brazil.\n\nBrazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, posted condolences on his X account and highlighted Yu's work:\n\nFoi com tristeza e consternação que recebi a notícia do desastre aéreo ocorrido no Pantanal no início da noite desta terça-feira, 23. A tragédia, infelizmente, custou as vidas do piloto Marcelo Pereira de Barros, dos documentaristas Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz e Rubens… — Lula (@LulaOficial) September 24, 2025\n\nIt was with sadness and consternation that I received the news about the aircraft disaster that happened in the Pantanal regional, early Tuesday night, the 23rd. The tragedy, unfortunately, took the lives of the pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, documentarians Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., and the Chinese architect Kongjian Yu. In times of climate change, Kongjian Yu became a world reference for sponge cities, which unite life quality and environment protection: something we want — and need — for the future. To all the victims’ friends, family and coworkers, I leave my deepest sorrows.\n\nYu’s legacy\n\nYu was in Brazil to work on a documentary, but he had also recently attended the São Paulo International Architecture Biennale, which was themed “EXTREMES — Architectures for an overheated planet.” Raquel Schenkman, the Institute of Brazilian Architects’ president, responsible for the Biennale’s organization, told G1 Yu was “someone on the frontline of transformations in big urban centers facing climate change.”\n\nOn its website, the Biennale published a note saying that, as the “creator of the theory of sponge cities, Yu Kongjian left a monumental legacy, also urgent to face climate crisis in cities,” and that his work, based on ecosystemic principles, “showed in a practical and poetic way how the landscape can be a vital infrastructure to urban resilience, integrating man to nature in a sustainable way.”\n\nSponge cities concept\n\nYu’s main legacy is designing and implementing projects based on his sponge cities theory. A professor at Peking University, his “sponge city” concept became a top national priority in China in 2013, following the massive floods in the Beijing region in 2012, which left 79 people dead and tens of thousands displaced. He also founded Turenscape, one of the main landscape architecture firms in the world, based in China.\n\nYu cautioned against overly “grey” cities that rely too much on concrete and asphalt, which disrupt natural water pathways and prevent the ground from absorbing water. While conventional water management focuses on draining water through engineered drainage infrastructure, such as pipes and water channels, sponge cities rely on techniques such as green roofs, rainwater storage and infiltration systems, sunken green spaces, permeable pavement, bioretention ponds, wetland revitalization, restoring natural waterflow pathways, and more.\n\n“Floods are not enemies,” Yu explained in an interview with WeForum. “We can make friends with floods. We can make friends with water.”\n\nYu’s approach to urban planning has been successfully implemented in dozens of cities in China, particularly after Chinese President Xi Jinping established his thoughts on ecological civilization in 2018.\n\nIn the past decade, his natural landscape approach is becoming an important tool in city planning and water management around the world.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, where recurring extreme weather events routinely cause massive floods that displace hundreds of thousands, many city planners are looking to sponge cities as a potential solution for unprecedented levels of rainfall.\n\nSo far, the concept has mostly been implemented on a small scale in individual neighborhoods, streets, or areas, meaning its flood mitigation impacts are often limited to the local level, rather than city- or nationwide.\n\nOn X, Zhongshan city's tourism promotion outlet, commemorates Yu's death by highlighting one of his landscape projects in the southern Chinese city:\n\nOn September 23 (Brazilian time), Professor Yu Kongjian from the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at #Peking University, tragically passed away in a plane crash at the age of 62. Professor Yu had won numerous world-class #design awards, including the Oberlander Prize and the John Cobb Common Good Award. Among his representative works is the #QijiangPark in #Zhongshan, #Guangdong . This #park, transformed from the site of a former shipyard, opened in 2001 and quickly gained global attention, winning several domestic and international design awards. In designing and building the park, Professor Yu and his team preserved the original industrial relics, such as shipyard machinery, docks, and other structures, and repurposed them with new functions. [original English version from @Amzhongshan]\n\nYu himself acknowledged that scaling up the pilot projects in Chinese cities was challenging. One of his sponge city projects in Zhengzhou faced backlash after a severe flood in 2021, which claimed 12 lives in the city, prompting many to express doubts about the practicality of his idea. Moreover, as China's coastal regions are highly industrialized, they demand cross-departmental collaboration, strong political will, and extensive administrative coordination to restore concrete riverbanks and seawalls to wetlands.\n\nIn an interview with Brazilian news outlet G1, Yu said that on a scale of 1 to 10, his optimism regarding the world’s chances of reversing climate change ranked 4. He also mentioned water scarcity — one of the challenges his projects aimed to address — as the primary issue humanity will face over the next 25 years.\n\nA journalist living in China, Isabela Shi, shared Yu Kongjian’s last update on a Chinese social media platform:\n\n🕯️No último vídeo que o arquiteto chinês Yu Kongjian divulgou na rede social chinesa, ele estava mostrando a viagem a Pantanal com equipa brasileira que tenta refletir sobre Planeta Esponja através de encolhimento de zonas húmidas. “Wonderful, amazing”, encantou ele pro Brasil. pic.twitter.com/fKn5ZKgIwe — Isabela Shi🇨🇳🇧🇷 (@ShiIsabela) September 25, 2025",

    "title": "How a comics school taught perseverance and creative freedom in Bosnia & Herzegovina",
    "text": "This article by Adin Kadrić first appeared in Balkan Diskurs on September 12, 2025. An edited version is being republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement with the Post-Conflict Research Center (PCRC).\n\nEditor's note: Zenica is a city in the middle of Bosnia and Herzegovina with about 100,000 residents. It is noted for its ironworks industry as well as being home to one of the big prisons in ex-Yugoslavia, described in the cult rock song Zenica Blues. It is not often considered when speaking about art, making the significance of this initiative — which began during the war of 1992-1995 and still persists to this day — even more extraordinary.\n\nFor over 30 years, the Zenica School of Comics has been not only an illustration school but a symbol of perseverance, cultural resistance, and lasting dedication to art. Initially conceived as an escape from the repression of the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and later, a platform for expression and creativity, the school has trained around 200 young artists. About 70 of them have gone on to become prominent young authors, whose works have left a mark on the domestic and regional comics scene.\n\nSeveral graduates are even acclaimed beyond the borders of their country, with Kenan Halilović, Biljana Šafaražik, and Zdravko Cvjetković being some of the most prominent. While the school has been synonymous with quality and creativity within the domestic comic scene for years, the international acclaim for these artists’ work underscores the fact that Zenica maintains a firm foothold in this visual medium.\n\nRecalling its beginnings, Adnadin Jašarević, the school’s founder and director of the Zenica City Museum, said that its primary goal was to give children a creative escape from the harsh realities of war. Under such conditions, comics were like Alice in Wonderland — providing an escape from hunger, fear, and shelling. An average of ten students still pass through the school every year, learning how to translate their thoughts, fears, and hopes into dynamic sequences of frames and speech clouds.\n\nNewer names like Filip Andronik, Milorad Vicanović, Senad Mavrić, and Enis Čišić represent the contemporary wave of comic artists from BiH. They actively cooperate with renowned publishers from the United States and Europe, demonstrating that despite its underdeveloped infrastructure, Bosnia and Herzegovina has comic creators who can stand equally alongside the best talent the genre has to offer.\n\nPublications such as “Horostop,” “ZE strip,” “EKO strip” and “SUV – Steps in Time” were created at the Zenica School, showcasing both its longevity and its dedication to comic culture. Explaining that the students themselves choose the topics they work on according to their own interests, Jašarević noted that he has “never stopped working” to ensure that comics remain a tool for expression and creative release.\n\nAs far as technology’s impact on the comic industry goes, Jašarević explained that while comics used to be widely available to the masses, they are now becoming a far more exclusive product, with expensive integral editions and albums intended for a small but loyal audience. While the idea behind ​​comics as a liberating medium remains the same, the development of technology has heralded a turn in modern-day comic production.\n\nCartoonist and former Zenica student Zdravko Cvjetković, in speaking about the impact of technology, emphasized that smart tablets have made drawing easier and faster for many artists, without compromising the quality of their work. However, he warned that AI tools — such as those used for generating text and images — pose serious ethical and aesthetic questions.\n\nHe believes that the mass availability of tools that produce images and stories in seconds, threatens to trivialize art and blur the line between creativity and automation: “If we all become artists just because we have a tool in our pocket, then nobody is really an artist.”\n\nMany things about comics today, according to Cvjetković, are drastically different than before the war: “Comics are no longer accessible to such a wide audience, especially children. They’re too expensive and rarely found in newsstands.”\n\nThe burgeoning Bosnian comics scene\n\nPointing out that children today reach for screens before print media like comics or books, Cvjetković said that publishers are therefore targeting older generations who grew up with comics.\n\nA positive outcome of this is the growing number of comics festivals in the region, which promote a culture of reading and drawing. “Workshops and comics contests for children [are] an almost mandatory part of every serious festival,” Cvjetković emphasized, “and this is crucial in the absence of comics schools like the one in Zenica.”\n\nComics culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina persists despite its modest ecosystem, in which there is almost no institutional support, and few major publishers or specialized festivals. However, thanks to the enthusiasm of individuals, the scene is not disappearing; in fact, it is quietly but steadily growing.\n\nAuthors like Berin Tuzlić and Enis Čišić have been representing BiH on the regional and international comics scene for years. Tuzlić, known for his experimental approach and multimedia projects, combines comics with music and animation. Čišić, who also tried his hand at Marvel productions, represents a more contemporary, technically precise form of expression. Their work shows that the country is producing talent capable of competing globally.\n\nIsmet Erdić also holds a special place on the BiH comics scene, with his rare combination of historical storytelling and visual narration in comics about Kulin Ban and medieval Bosnia. His work has educational value and is often used in classrooms, which makes him one of the few authors whose comics reach the general public.\n\nDespite unfavorable conditions for comic distribution, publicity, and marketing, comics culture in BiH is still preserved as a niche interest by enthusiasts. Social networks, web comics, and regional cooperation with authors from Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia are currently key to their survival. So, while relatively small, the BiH comics scene has an authentic flair and great potential, waiting for better times ahead.",

    "title": "Civil society initiative fights for equal education opportunities in Togo",
    "text": "In Togo, a national initiative built on civic solidarity helps relieve parents’ yearly back-to-school expenses.\n\nEducation is free and compulsory throughout the country, with a population of over 9.5 million. Following a two-month break (from mid-July to mid-September), more than 3 million students returned to school this month. While the authorities continue to work on improving education through teacher training and recruitment, investing in renovations and school infrastructure, the parents’ main priority is seeing their children succeed at the end of each school year.\n\nOver the years, there has been a marked increase in the gross enrollment rate and the proportion of Togolese students completing the school year. In April 2025, the local news website Lechiquier published:\n\n…le taut brut de scolarisation au primaire dépasse 100%. Il était de l’ordre de 111,70% en 2023, 116,70% en 2024 et une prévision de 116,20% pour l’année 2025. Dans le même sillage, le taux d’achèvement du primaire a évolué de 88,80% en 2023 à 94,60% en 2024. Pour l’année 2025, le gouvernement table sur une augmentation de 121,70%.\n\nThe gross primary school enrolment rate now exceeds 100 percent. In 2023, it was approximately 111.70 percent, in 2024 it was 116.70 percent, and 116.20 percent is forecast for 2025. Similarly, the primary school completion rate increased from 88.80 percent in 2023 to 94.60 percent in 2024. For 2025, the government forecasts an increase to 121.70 percent.\n\nThis rate of over 100 percent is due to it far exceeding the initial estimated value.\n\nFree school education\n\nTogo is one of five African countries with high enrollment rates in school, an impressive development stemming from the various reforms the authorities have implemented in the education sector. In 2008, Togo introduced free pre-school and primary education in the public sector. Since the beginning of the 2021–2022 school year, education in public secondary schools has also been free, a measure the authorities will maintain for the 2025–2026 school year.\n\nThese measures help combat inequities in accessing education. However, efforts, such as providing student school kits (notebooks, books, pens, pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, and school bags), are still required to tackle inequality and ensure universal coverage.\n\nTogo’s guaranteed monthly minimum wage (SMIG) increased from FCFA 35,000 (USD 64) in 2012 to FCFA 52,500 (USD 95) in early 2023. Although this measure was introduced to support the Togolese working population of over 4 million, not all are content with its implementation, condemning the country’s ongoing poor economic situation and challenging living conditions.\n\nAssociation contributions\n\nGiven the financial crisis, parents’ biggest concern is purchasing back-to-school supplies and kits. However, Togolese civil society provides solutions. Citizens, both young and old, are quick to lend their support to help parents meet these expenses.\n\nNumerous citizens, working as part of various associations, travel to the country’s villages and remote areas, assisting and supporting children, especially the most vulnerable. These efforts are a social and solidarity-based alternative to the associations committed to child protection, education, and development.\n\nOne example is Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (the Togolese Child Protection Association or LTPE). On August 29, 2025, LTPE supported 5,000 children from 12 villages of the Amou Prefecture in the Plateaux region.\n\nLe 29 août 2025, plus de 5 000 enfants de la préfecture d’Amou venus de 12 localités différentes ont reçu des kits scolaires grâce à l’initiative « Éducation pour tous : 1 élève, 1 kit, 1 choix de vie » portée par la #LTPE. pic.twitter.com/LMroVuE9oY — Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (@LTPE_ONG) August 30, 2025\n\nOn August 29, 2025, more than 5,000 children from 12 different locations in the Amou Prefecture received school kits through the #LTPE initiative ‘Education for All: One student, one kit, one life choice.’\n\nIn an interview with Togolese media outlet Plume d'Afrique, Nina Afi Kazoulé, the LTPE coordinator, explained the scope of this measure:\n\nNous voulons par cette action éviter le décrochage scolaire. Et nous savons que le décrochage scolaire peut être dû à l'incapacité financière des parents, aux grossesses en milieu scolaire, bref à tous les comportements qui ne sont pas appropriés à adopter par un apprenant.\n\nWe want to prevent school dropouts with this measure. We know that school dropouts can happen due to the parents’ lack of financial resources, pregnancies among school girls, or any inappropriate student behavior\n\nIn the village of Zooti N'titikope, Vogan, a town 45 kilometers northwest of the Togolese capital Lomé, the Togovi Bé Sourire association and Action for Peace and Good Governance (APGG) joined forces with several other associations on September 5 and 6 to support young learners. More than 300 vulnerable children received school kits, and 20 young girls will be monitored and supported in successfully reintegrating into school.\n\nLomé also has vulnerable children supported by other groups, including the Premiers Pas pour l’Enfance (First Steps for Children or 3PE) association. Its mission is to promote equal education opportunities through solidarity initiatives, such as the payment of school fees and supply provision for children. Association President Akilou Demon told media outlet Ledefenseur:\n\nNous voulons que tous les enfants aient accès à l’éducation, car l’enfant a droit à l’école. Si certains en sont privés, ce n’est pas juste. Notre ambition est de leur donner une chance égale de réussir et de contribuer demain au développement de notre patrie.\n\nAs children have the right to attend school, we want all children to have access to education. Some are deprived, and this is not fair. We aim to give them equal opportunities to succeed and one day contribute to our country’s development.\n\nAlthough the results of various reforms are visible, shortcomings remain in Togo’s education system.\n\nSchool infrastructure, such as classrooms, is substandard, especially in villages. Students study in straw huts with few school benches (supplemented in some places with bricks) and are forced to move or interrupt their lessons due to adverse weather conditions. In 2021, these circumstances led to construction plans for 30,000 classrooms equipped with wooden class benches. However, in September 2024, the government reduced its improvement projects by more than half, going from 30,000 classrooms to just 14,632.\n\nWhile civil society can offset some of the education system’s shortcomings, it’s ultimately up to the state, which declared education free and compulsory, to improve education quality and train new teachers to achieve equal opportunities for all Togolese children.",

    "title": "In Brazil, Romani people living in peripheral areas fight for recognition of their identities",
    "text": "This article, written by Artur Ferreira and Amanda Oliveira, was originally published on May 30, 2025, on the Agência Mural website. An edited version is published on Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nIn the collective imagination, the Romani people are associated with colourful clothing, parties, accessories, and an aura of mystery, embodying a wandering spirit. But beyond the stereotypes, there is a rich history of resistance and belonging that spans centuries, including in Brazil, in the outskirts of São Paulo.\n\nIn universities, public offices, doctors’ offices, or their traditional campsites, they are fighting for their rights, against prejudice, and for recognition in a country where there are still shortcomings in caring for the diversity of these communities.\n\nIn Itaim Paulista, a neighbourhood at the eastern end of the city, 250 people live in one of the main and oldest Romani campsites in the region.\n\n“Some Romanies palm read, dance, get dressed up in traditional clothing, but some are even evangelical, like myself, and they don’t all even live in camps. We are a people like any other,” the 32-year-old housewife Magda Santos says. She has been living in the camps for eight years with her husband and two children. “I am not Romani by blood, but I became one when I got married to one.”\n\nThe Romani, also known as the Roma peoples, are an ethnic group that doesn’t have a single origin. One of the more widely accepted theories is that they are of Indian origin but have travelled the world since the 11th century in a great diaspora, dispersing throughout the Balkans, Western Europe, and later to other continents.\n\nWhile she was hanging clothes on the clothesline, 29-year-old seamstress Viviane Alves Pereira made sure to find an answer when asked about the main problems her people face. The statement came without hesitation: prejudice, invisibility and the lack of access to basic rights, a common scenario in marginalized neighbourhoods.\n\nWho are the Roma people from the outskirts?\n\nThe majority of Romani who live on the outskirts of Greater São Paulo are of the Calon ethnicity, like Magda and Viviane. They are also those who suffer the most prejudice relating to maintaining their traditions and being most recognized as “gypsies” (a term now considered derogatory), because of their clothing and their nomadic lifestyle, according to sources from this report.\n\nIn Brazil, there are two other Romani ethnic groups: the Roma and the Sinti peoples. They don’t wear traditional clothing, so they mostly go unnoticed in the cities.\n\n“Many Brazilians were already cared for by doctors, nurses and Romani lawyers, and maybe they don’t even know,” states activist Nicolas Ramanush, 64, who is the president of the NGO, Romani Embassy of Brazil (Embaixada Cigana do Brasil), in Santo André in the Greater São Paulo area.\n\n“In the region, Romani people were concentrated in the neighborhood of Itaim Paulista and in the cities of Itaquaquecetuba and Itapevi, with camps near the train stations,” he says.\n\nEach ethnicity is divided into subgroups, and each one develops its own customs, habits, religions and rituals. “In my ethnic group, for example, we always wear decorated shoes with a lot of details. Some Calon women are famous for their flowery dresses and for using handkerchiefs,” says Ramanush, who belongs to the Sinti ethnicity.\n\nThis group has the fewest number of people in the country. “Today, if there are 100 families in Brazil, it is a lot,” says Ramanush. “This is because of the period of Nazism. The Sintis were almost exterminated. Among the Romani killed during the Holocaust, the majority were Sinti and Roma,” he adds.\n\nRamanush notes that many aspects of Romani culture are integrated into the Brazilian lifestyle without most people realizing it. They were among those responsible for helping Carnival to grow, especially in the northeast, creating Carnival street blocks. Certain costumes, such as “La Ursa” (The Bear) in Recife, have a Romani origin.\n\n“Instruments like the seven or six-string guitar were brought to Brazil by the Roma people. Some samba dancers spoke about how living with the Romanies inspired them musically,” Ramanush says.\n\nUnder the canvas tents\n\nNomadic and outskirt-dwelling Romani have a routine defined by difficulties surrounding education for their children and lack of healthcare, caused by the lack of a stable address. They also face São Paulo’s structural problems, such as floods, and living under canvas tents, without safety.\n\nOne of the most impactful natural disasters was the flooding in February 2025 in the far east of São Paulo, in the region known as Jardim Pantanal. The streets and houses remained underwater for several days. The Romani in these camps had to face that situation under the tents.\n\n“We spent days underwater, and it was the neighbors from the region who helped us,” Santos remembers with outrage.\n\nThe camp’s inhabitants had to deal with a lack of drinking water; tents were affected, and according to local accounts, they had to make a joint effort to avoid major losses of furniture and appliances while the flooding advanced.\n\nJust like Santos, Ramanush believes that the first step to improving the Romani community’s life in the outskirts of Brazil is for them not to be invisible.\n\nPrejudice and invisibility\n\nEven with initiatives such as the National Day of Roma Peoples, commemorated every May 24 since 2006, some rights are still neglected. For example, Romani people are not recognized in the national census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).\n\nSantos remembers the difficulty she faced in registering her children’s ethnic group in their identity documents. Since there is no official recognition of “Romani” ethnicity, she ended up registering them by their skin color.\n\n“There are policies catered to Indigenous peoples, Black and Brown people, but not for Romani people. We have our own culture, but we do not show up, which is why I say being Romani is being invisible,” she claims.\n\nRamanush experienced a similar situation when a census taker visited him during the most recent census in Brazil in 2022. “She asked me what my race was, and I answered that it was not on the list. My complexion is white, but I’m a Romani.”\n\nIBGE estimates that Brazil has between 800,000 and a million Romani, but the Roma groups believe the numbers are higher.\n\n“I've already travelled all over Brazil meeting Romani people from all ethnic groups. Without official data, there are no efficient public policies,” Ramanush explains. “Even to count how many Romani there are in each city or town, local governments make the process difficult.”\n\nBesides the lack of recognition, Romani people living in peripheral areas also face a prejudice that runs through generations. They have been accused of theft, robbery, and deception for centuries. It wasn’t rare to have them associated with kidnapping children.\n\nTrying to change this reality and fight prejudice, Romani groups have been mobilized for the approval of a bill making teaching Romani culture and history in schools mandatory — modeling what already happens with Black and Indigenous people in Brazil. The proposal presented by federal deputy Helder Salomão (PT, Workers’ Party), at the Chamber of Deputies as Bill 3547 of 2015, has made little progress.\n\nIn their justification, the text reinforces the idea that for centuries Romani groups have been experiencing prejudice, marginalization, exclusion and persecution. So, the bill aims to “change the image of Romani populations, trying to reduce prejudice and discrimination that these groups are subjected to.”\n\nThe bill also asserts that providing visibility for Romani groups “will provide a more fertile ground to build public policies focusing on the promotion of human rights.”",

    "title": "Cambodian and Thai activists unite to end hostility and promote peace over border disputes",
    "text": "This article was published by Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand. An edited version has been republished by Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement.\n\nBetween July and May 2025, tensions between Thailand and Cambodia over a border dispute devolved into violence that left at least 43 dead on both sides, dozens injured, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Despite signing a ceasefire agreement on July 28, hostility has remained deeply embedded in both countries, fueled by misinformation. Amidst the turmoil, Cambodians and Thais have come together to launch a cross-border campaign aimed at combating hatred and promoting empathy and lasting peace.\n\nThailand and Cambodia share over 700 kilometres of border, where several undemarcated sections have been long-standing sources of conflict between the two countries, since the Preah Vihear dispute beginning in the 1950s, to this year when clashes broke out on May 28th and led to fatalities on July 24th. On top of that, the countries also share historical and cultural ties, which have complicated the tensions between them, leading to deep-rooted hostility between the two peoples.\n\nHostility skyrocketed after the July 24 armed conflict as the conflict between the two governments trickled down to all facets of society. Cambodian and Thai netizens traded accusations on who initiated the clashes.\n\n“We see all the problems start to unfold, and when hatreds, prejudice, and discrimination on people’s level have gone online, it was even more devastating for us, and that's why we decided to come together on the Cambodian side to rally among ourselves,” said Lim Solinn, a Cambodian social activist and artist. She later reached out to friends in Thailand in different places and then stumbled upon a group of Thai people who are a network of solidarity.\n\nOu Tepphallin, a Cambodian labor rights activist and campaign co-organizer, said she joined the campaign to address the suffering of migrant workers and communities caught in the crossfire of recent tensions, particularly Cambodian workers in Thailand and Thai workers in Cambodia.\n\nThey faced physical violence and racism, and they were living with fear, so their voices were unheard. On top of that, children living along the border have lost opportunities to study due to the closure of border crossings. Family members were separated, such as a child whose mother was in Thailand but whose father was in Phnom Penh, and they have no idea when they can be reunited.\n\nIn addition, according to the Thai authorities, the conflict since July 24th has also caused over 500,000 Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand to return home, since most of them felt unsafe and threatened in Thailand. This has left Thailand with a significant labor shortage as Cambodian migrants typically played an essential role in the country's agricultural industry.\n\nSolinn stated that both Thai and Cambodian campaign organizers want the campaign to go viral in both countries and send messages to leaders saying, “Please don't use violence on Cambodian or Thai migrant workers.”\n\nThe campaigners are also trying to figure out catchy ways for this campaign to go viral and reach regular Thais and Cambodians. The campaign includes writing poems and making songs, which they believe could help calm people and encourage them not to hate simply because of what they heard or saw on the news.\n\n“We’re just starting, even if the war ends tomorrow, the hatred continues, so we need to continue this work and reach out to more communities in Cambodia and in Thailand,” said Solinn.\n\nPhallin added that it's time to heal those who suffered from both sides, and that is what the campaign did by starting to send healing messages to ordinary people.\n\nWhen hatred is louder than empathy\n\nIn Thailand, when the armed conflict erupted and innocent Thai civilians and military personnel were killed, many Thai netizens demanded tit for tat retaliation. In addition, right-wing influencers have threatened Cambodian migrant workers and called on patriots to use violence against them.\n\nOften, those who oppose this and call for a peaceful approach face condemnation online for being too optimistic or unpatriotic.\n\n“All the ordinary Cambodians want nothing but peace and harmony with our neighbours, and a lot of people get caught in between these polarizations, and because of the level of their vulnerability, they cannot get their voices heard at all,” noted Solinn.\n\nOn the Cambodian side, Solinn remarked that while they wanted peace and for this war to stop, most Cambodians also became enraged and emotional when they saw news about civilians being affected, schools being bombed, or news that many people were displaced.\n\nShe disclosed that since she and her friends launched the campaign, she has been harassed by netizens from both countries. For her, it has been difficult to get through to people how the hyper-nationalistic, violent narratives are spreading hate. Solinn said:\n\nThey have been misinformed and disinformed. They believe these sets of stories, and they have these perspectives, and it's hard to change. So, instead of trying to tell them a different version, we’re trying to appeal to their consciousness. We try to appeal to their empathy.\n\nEven though most of the information they received was not real, it was effective as it was coupled with prejudice, stereotyping, and hate speech amplified by social media. “It has added fuel to the fire of ultra nationalist perspectives. It just made it really hard for people to try to bridge across for people who are like us,” said Solinn.\n\nShe insisted that engaging with the same outrage and accusing each other of doing what each side thinks is wrong will not improve the situation, particularly for disputes that have been going on for hundreds of years, based on selective history from both sides.\n\nSolinn emphasized that it was time to put people’s lives first. Children should be able to return to school instead of living in refugee camps, families should be able to earn their livelihoods again, and both countries need to recognize the damage the conflict has inflicted on their economies.\n\nA call for peace: rebuilding trust and fostering empathy\n\n“We would like to urge the leaders to sit down and find a peaceful resolution and put the people first,” said Phallin. She also urged the leaders to negotiate and rebuild trust, insisting that peace can be achieved only by negotiation, not war.\n\nIn the meantime, Solinn urged the leaders to be compassionate and gentle and to reach a peaceful resolution, adding that a tremendous amount of strength is required. The campaign organizer also called on leaders on both sides to stop this war and allow everything to return to normal for the sake of the innocent people from both countries.\n\nShe suggested that Thailand and Cambodia stop promoting biases and stereotypes based on selective interpretations of history, particularly for the younger generations.\n\nSolinn also believes that when this war ends, Thais and Cambodians will come together to create mixed communities where people from both sides could share safe spaces and raise awareness of peace and harmony.\n\n“Educating in school or through the media wouldn't be enough. We need all the spaces, all the communities, we need a whole society to heal and to promote racial tolerance, peace, solidarity, and harmony,” said Phallin.\n\nIn terms of media, Solinn said media, particularly mainstream media, in both countries should not amplify hateful rhetoric, which has already been dominant on social media, but rather people’s stories, which would help promote reconciliation and peace, suggesting that selective parts of the history on both sides shouldn’t be allowed to frame the whole narrative about Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nShe noted that we did not know everything, but only heard different sides of the story. Each side believed the other started the war first or believed that the other side encroached upon their land.\n\n“Trust is so fragile. It's so easy to break, and it's broken already. It's very hard to rebuild, but we must try. We do not have a choice,” noted Solinn.",

    "title": "The judiciary’s dilemma: Protecting Nigeria’s whistleblowers without legislation",
    "text": "Nigeria’s whistleblower policy, introduced on December 21, 2016, was designed as a quick fix to expose systemic corruption. It promised whistleblowers between 2.5 and 5 percent of recovered looted public funds. However, while the policy incentivizes disclosures, it does not guarantee protection.\n\nInstead, whistleblowers often face surveillance, dismissal, or even death threats. Multiple attempts to pass a whistleblower protection bill over the years have stalled in Nigeria’s National Assembly, leaving whistleblowers legally vulnerable.\n\nNigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework\n\nOn September 18, 2025, Federal High Court judges and civil society advocates debated on Nigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework at a national interactive forum convened by the African Centre for Media & Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) for federal high court judges, in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city.\n\nHarry Ogwuche, the Director of Economic and Social Rights at Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), shared during the debate:\n\nProtecting whistleblowers is not an abstract anti-corruption strategy; it is a direct, proactive investment in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights as enshrined in Chapter IV of our Constitution and various international covenants Nigeria is party to.\n\nThe role of judges in protecting whistleblowers\n\nWhile seeking the support of judges in the advocacy for a whistleblower protection law in Nigeria, Chido Onumah, Coordinator of AFRICMIL, said:\n\nJudges are key actors in any judicial system. Therefore, the forum aims to provide a platform for interaction with judges on whistleblowing, its legal framework, and the critical role they play in ensuring justice for whistleblowers and handling corruption cases effectively.\n\nAt the forum, persecuted whistleblower Yisa Usman shared how he was pressured, intimidated, and sidelined from his profession after blowing the whistle on his company. Usman is a chartered accountant who worked in the finance and accounts department, but after exposing corruption, he was redeployed to the ICT department, transferred to different states, and subsequently fired. He said:\n\nBecause I decided to speak up, I am jobless. I was ostracized and frustrated to accept the norm. To remain silent is to be complicit. To achieve results as a whistleblower, it is important to be familiar with the laws because if you know the laws that guide and protect you, you will be able to challenge them. Despite several attempts to detain me, I am walking free because of the judiciary.\n\nExisting and pending laws to protect whistleblowers\n\nNigeria’s Constitution and several statutes already contain protections that could be extended to whistleblowers. These include: Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. Section 6(4)(c) of the National Human Rights Commission Act prohibits harassment of individuals who cooperate with the Commission. Anti-corruption laws like the EFCC Act and ICPC Act provide limited safeguards. The Freedom of Information Act protects disclosures made in good faith.\n\nIn practice, these fragmented provisions are inconsistently applied, and without a unified protection law, whistleblowers continue to face retaliation.\n\nNigeria’s situation contrasts sharply with that of its regional neighbors. Ghana’s Whistleblower Act (Act 720) and South Africa’s Protected Disclosures Act provide dedicated mechanisms.\n\nVladimir Radomirović, a Serbian journalist and co-founder of Pištaljka, an organization based in Belgrade that provides free legal aid and protection to whistleblowers, shared his experiences of building alliances with the judiciary to strengthen whistleblower protection in Serbia. He said:\n\nThe judges have a very influential role in protecting whistleblowers in Serbia, and we try to work with judges and allow them to hear from whistleblowers about how they are retaliated against for protecting the public interest.\n\nAFRICMIL and its partners urged the Nigerian legislature to urgently enact the whistleblower protection law, one that guarantees anonymity, provides penalties against retaliation, and establishes an independent body to oversee cases.\n\nWhistleblowers and civil society organizations appealed to judges to embrace a proactive role in safeguarding whistleblowers. They called for progressive adjudication that interprets existing laws in the spirit of transparency and protection for defenders; expedited hearings to ensure justice is not delayed and therefore denied; the awarding of exemplary damages against retaliators to serve as a deterrent; and above all, the protection of anonymity in court procedures. These recommendations, they argued, are vital if the judiciary is to strengthen trust, uphold justice, and ensure that whistleblowing truly serves as a tool for accountability in Nigeria.",

    "title": "Nepal’s Khoj Samachar challenges corruption and empowers youth through digital media",
    "text": "There are nearly 4,900 registered print media outlets in Nepal. Around eighteen news outlets operate exclusively online through digital platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. By law, online media must register with Nepal’s Department of Information and Broadcasting; however, not all outlets currently comply with this requirement.\n\nStanding out among these registered outlets is Khoj Samachar, an independent digital media platform that raises awareness among young people, challenges corruption, and amplifies underrepresented voices in Nepal. Its founder, Roshan Shrestha, is an investigative journalist from Nepal. His approach relies on digital platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and a dedicated app to draw public attention to marginalized stories and pressure authorities to take action. The platform publishes content in Nepali, in both text and video formats.\n\nAbdulrosheed Fadipe of Global Voices interviewed Roshan via WhatsApp to discuss his journey as an investigative journalist and how he uses digital platforms to promote social change, strengthen good governance, and encourage citizen engagement in Nepal.\n\nGlobal Voices (GV): What inspired you to start Khoj Samachar, and what challenges did you face in building it from scratch?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): I started my journalism journey during my school years at Shree Bachchhala Devi Higher Secondary School, Nagpuje, Sindhupalchok District, in Bagmati Province of Nepal. When I was in class 8, a man who was the presenter at Avenues Television came to my school to teach students about journalism. That training programme planted the seed of journalism in my mind.\n\nMy interest in journalism grew after a devastating earthquake occurred in Nepal in 2015. Although the epicenter of the earthquake was located in Gorkha district, many houses in my village, which is located near the Bhotekoshi River, were destroyed. Many people lost their lives. The Tataponi border crossing with China was also closed. I had just completed class 11 then. I was using a simple Android phone because I was from a low-middle-class family that depended on agriculture for a living. With that phone, I started filming and uploading videos of the earthquake's destruction of villages on a YouTube channel. This was how my journalism career began.\n\nIn 2021, I officially launched Khoj Samachar. I did not receive any financial support when I started nor did I have a big team. Now we have a team of four individuals broadcasting news in both English and Nepali.\n\nGV: How do you maintain editorial independence and ensure your outlet's content remains unbiased and free from external influences?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): We do not take money, favors, or support from any political party, business group, or outside donor. From day one, Khoj Samachar has survived only through the income we earn from Facebook and YouTube ads. With those limited earnings, we pay our team and run the entire platform. This is not always easy, but it gives us full freedom. Nobody can tell us what to say or what to hide. We can question leaders, expose corruption, and speak for the people without fear of losing sponsors or upsetting funders. Our only loyalty is to our readers and viewers. For us, independence is more valuable than comfort. Even if the road is difficult, we choose truth over compromise — that is why our content remains unbiased and trusted.\n\nGV: How do you prioritize stories that amplify underrepresented media voices, and what impact do you hope these stories have on your audience?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): At Khoj Samachar, we always give priority to the voices that big media often ignores — farmers, workers, rural youth, and ordinary citizens who face injustice. Many times, people from villages directly contact us to share their pain, because they feel unheard elsewhere.\n\nWe have highlighted stories like that of a person struggling to get a bridge built in his village, a road left unfinished for 10 years, or a family trapped in hardship without support. By showing these issues through videos, we try to bring public attention and pressure the authorities to act.\n\nOur hope is that by giving a platform to these underrepresented voices, young people will feel more connected, more aware, and inspired to raise their own voices. We want our audience to see that journalism is not only about leaders and cities, but also about the real struggles of common people — and that truth can bring real change.\n\nGV: What strategies do you use to reach audiences beyond capital cities, and how do you measure the impact of your reporting in these areas?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): From the beginning, our focus was not only on Kathmandu but also on rural and remote areas. We create stories that reflect the real problems of villages — like missing bridges in Humla, neglected roads in Dailekh, or migrant workers’ struggles. Many of these issues are sent to us directly by local people through phone calls, Facebook messages, or our app. By turning their voices into reports and videos, we make sure their problems are heard nationally.\n\nTo measure impact, we look at the response from citizens and authorities. For example, in Saudi Arabia, when stranded workers contacted us, our coverage led to parliamentary debates and direct government action. Similarly, when we cover local problems, we monitor community feedback in comments, shares, and messages, and also check if the government or local representatives respond. For us, the real impact is when ordinary people feel their voices are finally heard and some positive change begins.\n\nGV: What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced as an independent journalist, and how have you overcome them?\n\nRS: There have been many difficult moments in my journey, but the most painful ones came when some people, who are unable to accept the truth, started abusing my family and even threatened physical attacks in public. As a journalist, I can tolerate criticism and risk, but when my family is dragged into controversy for my work, it is truly unbearable.\n\nSpeaking the truth, especially against corruption and powerful figures, always brings political pressure. Many tried to silence us or scare us into stopping, but journalism loses its meaning if we compromise with fear. What keeps me going is the trust and support of the public and the inner courage to always speak the truth. The emotional burden is heavy, but I continue because ordinary people rely on us to be their voice, and that responsibility gives me the strength to move forward.\n\nGV: How do you envision the future of Khoj Samachar, and what steps are you taking to ensure its sustainability and continued impact?\n\nRS: My main goal is to build Khoj Samachar as a platform based only on truth and facts, not dependent on external funding or political power. The message I want to pass to youth is that they can succeed in journalism by standing for the truth, even if they are alone. I am working to add more features to the Roshan Shrestha App so that it will be useful for the public. This step will help us sustain our work, expand our impact, and keep serving society with independent journalism.\n\nGV: Why did you name the Roshan Shrestha App after yourself?\n\nRS: By putting my own name on the app, I wanted to assure users that this platform is genuine, transparent, and trustworthy. It is not for self-promotion but rather a matter of responsibility: if my name is attached, people know they can rely on it.",

But sharp cuts to foreign aid by a number of governments are shrinking the available funds for nonprofits, with digital rights organizations like ours taking a particular hit.\n\nAnd it’s a hard time for news and translation organizations right now, with new technologies being used to cut staff and mass-produced disinformation crowding out quality news. Even in this challenging time, Global Voices’ production and readership have been going up, but since we are committed to never paywalling and not showing ads, that doesn’t translate into covering our running costs unless readers donate.\n\nGlobal Voices is a relatively low-cost organization to run: we have no office, no rent, and few physical supplies. We pay for the servers that host our site and a few other administrative costs, but by far the majority of our expenses are for paying our staff. Many grants don’t want to fund more than a small percentage of personnel costs, because they want to pay directly for activities, but personnel costs are the basis of all our activities. Our staff and our volunteers research stories, write and edit, translate and advocate — and sometimes they also do graphic design or photo choice, social media promotion, and more. That is who we’re trying to support with the funds from this campaign — our community, the people who make the articles and essays, translations, research reports, and podcasts that you find on our site.\n\nIf we had a dollar for every page view of the site, we wouldn't need to do a campaign! And if each of those dollars were a monthly commitment, we’d be able to plan ahead for longer-term activities and be generally less stressed. But we know that not everyone can contribute for lots of different reasons, so instead we can think about it as five dollars from one-fifth of the monthly site visits, or ten dollars from one-tenth, and maybe someone who hasn't read anything this month but believes in what we do kicks in twenty-five bucks, and someone else who loves translations sends another fifteen and… you get the idea.\n\nWe hope that you can be one of those contributors, and if you can’t right now, we hope you still come and spend time on our site, and then tell other people about it. Even more than a news site, Global Voices is a community, and we’d like you to be a part of it.

    "title": "The paradox of women’s rights in Peru",
    "text": "By Grecia Flores Hinostroza\n\nIn Peru, women’s rights exist in a strange paradox: on paper, we have the laws, the representation, and the international commitments that promise equality; in reality, our lives tell a different story. Political progress coexists alongside persistent neglect, with numbers that flatter and figures that fail. This contradiction is not hidden in the shadows — the painful contrast is written plainly in the numbers we so proudly display.\n\nAccording to the SDG Gender Index, Peru scores 72.9 for “Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments,” a figure that suggests progress, visibility, and leadership. And yet, when we shift our gaze to health, the score drastically drops to 35.5, barely half. Women are present in Congress, but absent from the healthcare system that should protect them.\n\nIf political participation alone were enough, our streets would be safer, our hospitals accessible, and our voices heard beyond the voting booth. But in Peru, as in much of Latin America, representation has not broken the chains of inequality — it has simply made them less visible to those who govern.\n\nThe data tells one story. The lives of rural, Indigenous, and poor women tell another — one where access to basic sexual and reproductive health services is a distant reality. Where hospitals, experts, and care are unreachable. As the political scientist Stéphanie Rousseau notes in “The Politics of Reproductive Health in Peru,” “Although health sector reforms have had some positive impact on women’s reproductive health, the many restrictions placed on women’s right to reproductive choices have blocked further progress.”\n\nThe consequences are not abstract. In 2020, Peru’s maternal mortality ratio stood at 69 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the World Health Organization, far above the Latin American average of 45 and nearly five times that of Chile (16) and Uruguay (13). These numbers represent women whose lives could have been saved by timely care, safe births and the fulfilment of rights already recognized by law.\n\nBut these injustices are not only moral failures; they are legal betrayals. Peru has signed its name beneath international promises: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and others. These are not distant treaties gathering dust in diplomatic archives. They are binding commitments, written to safeguard the dignity, health, and safety of women — commitments meant to reach every hospital room, courtroom, and remote village in our country.\n\nLaws protecting sexual and reproductive health rights exist on paper, but they remain distant from the realities of rural, Indigenous, and poor women. Clinics lack essential services. Comprehensive reproductive care is unavailable. Legal frameworks declare equality, but equality disappears in places where women still face forced pregnancies, unsafe births, and systemic neglect.\n\nThe Constitution speaks of equality, but equality does not walk the roads where women carry their pregnancies alone. The Ministry of Health issues protocols, but those protocols do not save lives when the nearest health centre is closed, or when the only doctor is gone. Rights without access are hollow. Commitments without implementation are betrayal.\n\nIn this context, political representation must not be mistaken for liberation. We cannot accept the illusion of progress that comes from more women in office if it is not matched by concrete action to dismantle structural barriers. Empowerment is not an empty slogan — it is the lived reality without fear, accessing healthcare without barriers, and raising one’s voice without retaliation.\n\nThe gap between law and life is not an abstract policy flaw; it is a daily crisis. It is the young girl in a rural province forced to give birth after sexual assault because abortion is inaccessible. It is the mother who dies on the way to a hospital that never has the capacity to treat her. Likewise, it is the Indigenous community where reproductive rights exist only in the language of faraway courts, not in the practice of local healthy systems.\n\nIf we measure success only by the presence of women in power, we ignore the absence of justice in their communities. Numbers in parliament cannot compensate for empty maternity wards. International recognition cannot replace the right to safe childbirth.\n\nI call on the Peruvian Congress to legislate not for appearances, but for autonomy. To ensure that health, safety, and dignity are realities in every province. I call on international donors to fund the fight for reproductive freedom, not just political participation. And I call on Peruvian society to recognize that representation without rights is no victory at all.\n\nRepresentation matters. But it is only the beginning. Real empowerment is when every woman controls her future — her body, her health, her voice — regardless of where she was born or how far she lives from the capital. Until the day, the paradox will remain, and progress will be a promise half-kept.",

    "title": "Pro-government campaign against student protests attempts to justify repression in Serbia",
    "text": "This analysis by Nataša Stanojević was originally published by the International and Security Affairs Centre (ISAC), part of the regional initiative Western Balkans Anti-Disinformation Hub. An edited version is republished by Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nThe protest held on June 28 this year in Belgrade, on the Serbian national and religious holiday, Vidovdan, represented the culmination of months of public discontent with government policies and systemic societal problems.\n\nVidovdan is deeply rooted in national history and collective memory and has often been used as a symbol of political and moral struggle. In this case, students and other citizens chose the date to underscore the seriousness of their demands for responsible governance, to call for snap elections, and advocate for essential institutional reforms.\n\nAccording to estimates, the protest gathered around 140,000 people, making it one of the largest political gatherings in the past decade. The sheer size of the turnout reflects profound social frustration and a sense that institutional mechanisms for expressing discontent have completely failed. However, while the organizers’ demands were clearly defined — fighting corruption, institutional accountability, and democratization of the system — pro-government media constructed an entirely different picture.\n\nInstead of fact-based reporting, the public sphere was flooded with sensationalist headlines and claims aimed at delegitimizing the protests and criminalizing participants. The student movement and citizens were not portrayed as advocates of democratic values, but as a threat to the stability of the state. This strategy of criminalization, typical of authoritarian regimes, allowed the authorities to justify the use of force and intensified repression.\n\nPro-government media in Serbia systematically employ false and manipulative narratives to discredit legitimate civic protests and normalize the state’s repressive responses. Analysis shows that key propaganda tactics include labeling participants, manipulating events, constructing an image of a foreign enemy, and glorifying police force. These practices have long-term consequences for democratic processes and freedom of expression.\n\nInstruments of the propaganda narrative\n\nOne of the most commonly used strategies was the deployment of pejorative labels. Organizers and participants were not referred to as students or citizens but as “blockaders,” “hooligans,” and “terrorists.”\n\nA headline in the tabloid newspaper Informer, “Anti-hooligan operation in the city center: Watch how blockaders are arrested,” illustrates how police intervention was presented as necessary and legitimate, while citizens were criminalized. The term “terrorists” carries particularly strong connotations, suggesting extremism, even though the protests were peaceful in nature.\n\nMedia outlets widely circulated narratives about an alleged “hellish plan” by demonstrators. Headlines such as “Bridges and the entire city under siege: The new hellish plan of blockader terrorists, they want blood and dead bodies on the streets!” create an atmosphere of fear and suggest inevitable escalation into violence. These unfounded claims serve to mobilize the government’s loyal voter base and legitimize repressive measures. Rhetoric about “blood on the streets” and “danger to citizens” not only criminalizes protest participants but also frames them as a national security threat.\n\nPro-government discourse attributed goals to the protesters, such as “destroying the state” and “overthrowing the president.” These claims are not based on any documents or public statements by organizers, whose demands focused on improving safety, fighting corruption, and ensuring political accountability. Introducing accusations of “treason” and “collaboration with enemies” is part of a broader model of political propaganda in which social resistance is portrayed as a conspiracy against national interests.\n\nWhile pro-government media insisted on an image of violent demonstrations, actual events tell a different story. According to reports from independent media and human rights organizations, the majority of the protest was peaceful. This was also confirmed by the Council of Europe.\n\nThe few incidents that occurred happened only after police intervention, during which excessive force was used. The arrests or detentions of hundreds of people, along with documented cases of physical abuse, clearly show that state repression was the dominant dynamic. This gap between the media narrative and empirical facts is a classic example of the framing technique — selective presentation of reality to shape public opinion.\n\nThe broader political context and the foreign enemy narrative\n\nParticularly concerning is the strategy of linking the protests to alleged foreign enemies, in this case, Croatia. Certain tabloids and politicians suggested that the organizers of the protests were instruments in the hands of Croatian intelligence structures and that their goal was the destabilization of Serbia. These claims have no factual basis, but serve a clear propaganda purpose: to evoke historical tensions and use national stereotypes to create a sense of threat among citizens. (The hostilities between Serbia and Croatia have deep roots in their national narratives. These tensions began during the Ottoman Empire when many Serbian refugees were settled in Croatia by the Austrian authorities. The animosity intensified during World War II when Croatia joined the Axis powers, and was solidified during the wars that accompanied Yugoslavia’s breakup. This period culminated in Operation Storm, which resulted in the majority of Serbs fleeing Croatia.)\n\nThe use of Croatia in this narrative has a dual function: first, to mobilize patriotic sentiment; by suggesting that the protests are connected to a “hostile state,” the government reinforces its image as the defender of national interests. Second, it discredits the opposition and civic initiatives; by attributing “foreign influence” to the protests, the government delegitimizes their goals and diverts attention from internal problems such as corruption and institutional breakdown. This rhetoric relies on the well-known model of “constructing a foreign enemy,” which, according to political communication theory, serves to homogenize the electorate and justify authoritarian practices.\n\nA particularly alarming segment of the propaganda campaign concerns the linkage of protests with the issue of Srebrenica. (The 1995 massacre of the Muslim population in Srebrenica and its surrounding areas by the Army of Republika Srpska is frequently exploited by both nationalist and anti-Western factions in Serbia. Similar to narratives that deny the Holocaust, discussions about Srebrenica range from complete denial to unsettling debates about the number of victims, their nationality, and the use of terms like “necessary military action” and “collateral damage.” Over the past 15 years, anyone who does not support these narratives has been labeled a “traitor” or a “Western agent” in official political discourse.)\n\nIn an Informer article entitled “They’ve exposed themselves! This is blockader politics: Accusing Serbia of a nonexistent genocide in Srebrenica,” students were accused of “agreeing with accusations that brand Serbs as a genocidal nation.” This narrative attempts to shift the focus from demands for democratization to a national question, creating the impression that the protests have an “anti-Serbian agenda.” In this way, civic resistance is criminalized through manipulation of one of the most emotionally charged issues in the public sphere.\n\nA similar rhetoric is used by the portal Vaseljenska in the article “Blockaders want to declare Serbs a genocidal nation: Elections, then a government that will recognize the genocide in Srebrenica.” These claims are absent from any official demands of the organizers, but their function is clear: to discredit the protests by linking them with alleged plans to “betray national interests.” Thus, the government constructs a narrative in which students are not only “hooligans” but also agents of dangerous ideological and political projects.\n\nNarrative vs objective facts\n\nIn the long term, such practices lead to the consolidation of authoritarian patterns of governance. When every criticism of regime representatives is labeled as “treason” or “terrorism,” the space for democratic dialogue disappears. This not only delegitimizes protests but also undermines the fundamental values on which modern democratic societies rest.\n\nThis analysis of the media narrative surrounding the Vidovdan protests demonstrates that pro-government media act as a propaganda apparatus whose primary function is the preservation of political power, not informing the public. Through the dissemination of a distorted perception of civic resistance, the construction of violent scenarios, and the invention of foreign enemies, the authorities succeed in delegitimizing valid social demands and justifying repressive measures. Such a strategy may stabilize the regime in the short term, but in the long run, it erodes the foundations of democracy and leads to further political and social crises.",

    "text": "This Dart Centre Asia Pacific Report by Arun Karki was originally published in Nepali Times, and an edited version has been republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.\n\nWhat should a journalist do when young protesters are shot in front of her? Does she do her job and stay neutral? Can you stay neutral?\n\nAs Gen Z protests engulfed Kathmandu, Nepal's journalists found themselves reporting a story that was personal. While doing their job, some of them were even targeted by mobs.\n\nRead More: Gen Z stands up to expose corruption in Nepal\n\nDart Asia Pacific Fellow Arun Karki visited their newsrooms and spoke with his colleagues about their experience of reporting the Gen Z protests that erupted on September 8th. These are the first-hand accounts of journalists who witnessed the turmoil in the city they call home.\n\nSunita Karki was at a workshop in a hotel on September 8th. She saw the first waves of protests through hotel windows. Curfew alerts flooded her phone, a vehicle belonging to a human rights group sat burning across the road, young boys were taking their wounded friends on motorbikes to local hospitals, and police were beating a teenager with their hands raised.\n\n“I cried a lot,” she said, but the tears were not out of fear — they were because she felt guilt. “I couldn’t write the news. We were witnessing these scenes from a five-star hotel.” By evening, the death toll had reached 19. On September 9th at about 3:35 pm, her outlet, the Annapurna Post's office in Tinkune, Kathmandu, was set on fire. Staff had to leave the building as parts of the newsroom burned down.\n\nWhen she knew her office was burning, she anxiously told her husband that she would resign from the job: “If we have to hide our identification cards in every protest, what kind of journalist am I?” she asked herself.\n\nShe filed a story the next day, but her emotions kept bouncing between those of a journalist bound to duty and a civilian in shock. She said that in moments like this, it’s hard to feel truly neutral.\n\nAfter watching the police beat people, she felt a strong urge to step in, not just stand back and report. The first real calm came later, when people came to the street and lit candles together in honor of those who were killed. “This was a sort of victory procession. I felt some relief after brutal days,” she said.\n\nAngad Dhakal a photojournalist who works at Kantipur National Daily, was standing outside his office building when protesters stormed in and set parts of it on fire. He had already been informed that protesters were planning to torch his office building and rushed to his office hoping to save his hard drives containing ten years of photography work. He failed.\n\nHe raised his camera and “forcefully” pressed the shutter — more to document the scene than out of “professional enthusiasm or duty.”\n\n“My office was burning. What should I photograph?” he recalled. A few moments later, a protester noticed the “PHOTO” label on his yellow Press jacket. Dhakal deflected it by saying he was an early-career freelancer and YouTuber. He went into a corner and took his jacket off so that protesters wouldn't target him.\n\nWhen it comes to covering street protests, Angad usually stands near the police because it feels safer. But on September 8th, fire and gunshots made even that area unsafe. A rubber bullet hit his friend Dipendra Dhungana, badly injuring him.\n\nHe thought, “Where do we go now? If we stay here, we’ll be hit.” After witnessing two days of protests, violence, and killings, and seeing his own office burning, he couldn't sleep for days.\n\nThe same afternoon that government buildings burned and media outlet Kantipur was attacked, a message in a protest Discord forum talked openly of “attacking Kantipur.”\n\nRumors spread to other outlets. Outside OnlineKhabar's office, where Gaurav Pokharel works, the newsroom manager said, “Very suspicious people were walking around.” They lowered blinds, avoided windows, locked the front gate, and dispersed staff to other places across the city. The outlet was threatened and effectively locked down, but not torched.\n\nPokharel hid his press ID. “ I never showed the ID card. Sometimes I had to enter the crowd shouting slogans, just to blend in among the protesters,” he said. He watched people fall under gunfire, and he helped pull one surrounded journalist out of a hostile crowd.\n\nGaurav also contributed articles to international outlets as a freelancer. Later, while transcribing an interview of a young protest organizer, he wrote to his editor at an international outlet: “This was very hard to write. I cried many times while doing it.” He had been working at a stretch for days, battling bouts of exhaustion and low blood pressure.\n\nProtesters vandalized and set fire within the Singha Darbar complex housing Nepal Television and Radio Nepal. They tried to disrupt public broadcasting.\n\nSurendra Paudyal began the day with his press ID hanging on his neck, thinking it would let him move freely. But when he reached Singha Darbar around 3:30 pm, the situation felt dangerous.\n\nHe put the ID in his pocket. When asked what mattered most, he answered without pause: life comes first. In that moment, he felt real fear and a strong duty to protect his team.\n\nHis focus narrowed to basic things: stay calm, find exits, get everyone out safely. Later, they were able to keep the 8 pm news on air through a regional link. He felt mixed emotions and a sense of relief that the broadcast continued, but also sadness and anger that their own studio had come under attack.",

    "title": "The great silence surrounding marital rape in Senegal",
    "text": "By Bowel Diop\n\nGender-based violence, including marital rape, occurs worldwide, and often, the perpetrators are the victim's husband. Marital rape is defined as an act in which one partner forces the other to engage in non-consensual sex. A report by Equality, a US-based organisation with offices in New York, Nairobi, and London, reveals that many women are affected by this phenomenon, including many in Africa.\n\nIn private online forums where women post under anonymity, distressing testimonies emerge about the violence they suffer within relationships. Out of respect and for the protection of those sharing their stories, no names or platform details are revealed. Behind these testimonies emerges a chilling reality: that of sexual relations imposed within marriage without the woman’s consent, in other words, the reality of marital rape.\n\nAs violence against women becomes increasingly common, consent is being trampled. The notion of “conjugal duty” still frequently outweighs a woman’s right to make decisions about her body.\n\nIt is in these digital spaces, where distress is voiced and violence normalized, that discussion groups take shape, embodying a form of digital sisterhood. Providing room for listening, support, and open speech, these spaces enable women to challenge together the taboos that restrict their empowerment, online as well as offline. This safe space where women share their experiences underlines the urgency of an open and courageous debate on marital rape in Africa.\n\nA cultural, religious, and legal debate\n\nIn May 2025, the program “Midi Plus” on TFM Télévision Futur Média, based in Senegal, gave national exposure to Oustaz Modou Fall, a Muslim authority in the country. This preacher claims that conjugal duty takes precedence over consent, thereby legitimizing sexual violence in the name of marriage. Speaking in Wolof, he stated:\n\nGnouni loi bi néna sakh sa diabar so beugué teud akk mom té dacoroul daga ko violé . Pfff wakhi dof ! Sa diabar ga takk ko so farata Yallah akk souna Seydouna Mohamed , touki Pape Samba dem tournage soneu baye beugu dé gnibissi beugu teud ak sokhname gnouniko bouné dama soneu damadone fobéré (rires) ga forcéko viol le. Boudé lou amm la , lane moye texte bi. Si diné.\n\nPeople say the law declares that if you force your wife to have sex, that counts as rape. Pfff — absurd, this is your wife, the one you married before God. You travel, you work, Pape Samba [the host], you come back exhausted, you want to be with your wife, and she refuses. She says she’s tired, that she was doing the housework (laughter). So if you insist, it’s rape? If that’s the case, which religious scripture says so? We must be cautious about this.\n\nThe broadcast immediately sparked indignation across social media. On TikTok, activists and legal experts mobilized. The Xam Sa Droit page published a series of videos challenging Modou Fall’s statements against existing legislation. Specifically, it points to Article 320 of Senegal’s Penal Code, which defines rape as any act of penetration “carried out through violence, coercion, threat or surprise.” This is a reminder that marriage does not take away any fundamental rights, and that refusing sex, even within a couple, remains an inalienable right. This effort at legal education was met with strong support on TikTok, as it put consent back at the center of the discussion.\n\nVoices were also raised on X. Nabou Diop Lo, a lawyer and activist for women’s and children’s rights, posted:\n\nLe viol tel que définit dans le code pénal Sénégalais ne fait pas une distinction entre le viol commis dans le ménage et celui commis hors des liens conjugaux. Tout ce qui compte c'est le consentement de la victime. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nRape, as defined in the Senegalese Penal Code, makes no distinction between rape committed within marriage and that committed outside it. What matters is the victim’s consent. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nBut how can a woman dare complain she's been raped when a religious figure claims that a wife’s “no” carries no weight? This dissonance between the law, public discourse, and women’s lived reality highlights the urgent need for legal reform and a clear stance from the authorities.\n\nBy normalizing marital rape, this official rhetoric entrenches an absolute claim over women’s bodies and heavily compounds the moral weight borne by potential victims.\n\nEquality Now’s 2024 report shows that the legal recognition of marital rape differs significantly across Africa. The report notes that countries such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Madagascar, Senegal, and Togo explicitly criminalize marital rape.\n\nIn countries including Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Tanzania, spouses are explicitly exempted from prosecution, except in exceptional cases.\n\nIn Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mali, Uganda, and Chad, the law remains silent on the matter, creating a complete legal void.\n\nSenegalese law on rape and paedophilia, revised in 2020, sets out the definition of rape as follows:\n\nTout acte de pénétration « commis par violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise ».\n\nAny act of penetration ‘committed by violence, coercion, threat, or surprise.’\n\nHowever, the lack of clear legal provisions on marital rape and spousal consent creates a wide scope for interpretation, often to the detriment of the victim. As a result, marital rape is often treated as an ordinary form of domestic violence, rather than classified as a criminal offence.\n\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, for example, an investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde published in February 2024 reported that a humorous TikTok video mocking women’s sexual fatigue sparked amused reactions — evidence that sexual non-consent is not taken seriously.\n\nAccording to figures published in African Health Sciences, 33 percent of women in Africa have been subjected to sexual violence at some point in their lives, with rates rising to 44 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Côte d’Ivoire, 40 percent of women housed in the shelter run by the NGO Akwaba Mousso say they have suffered marital rape.\n\nIn many African legal systems, including in Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, the implicit presumption of consent between spouses prevents marital rape from being effectively recognised as a crime.\n\nWhen feminists raise awareness on the subject, the issue is frequently minimised. In the previously mentioned Le Monde article, Ivorian activist Marie-Paule Okri, co-founder of the Ivorian League for Women’s Rights, told the journalist:\n\nQuand on essaie d’en parler, on nous répond qu’on exagère. On nous inculque depuis l’adolescence que le corps de la femme est fait pour donner du plaisir à l’homme.\n\nWhen we try to talk about it, we are told we are exaggerating. From adolescence, we are taught that a woman’s body exists to give pleasure to men.\n\nYet Article 14 of the Maputo Protocol commits African states to guaranteeing women’s fundamental rights, including health and reproductive consent.\n\nBeyond legislation, it will take a deep change in attitudes to improve women’s condition, grounded in respect for their bodies and equality in relationships.",

    "text": "On October 7, 2023, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), the group that governs the Palestinian territory of Gaza, breached the barrier that has surrounded the densely populated area for the last 16 years, preventing the free flow of people and goods. The militants then launched an attack on 22 nearby Israeli settlements, towns, and military bases, killing around 1,200 civilians and soldiers and taking at least 199 hostages.\n\nMany governments around the world have condemned the attack as a war crime and act of terror, while other governments blamed Israel for setting the stage for these attacks to take place. Since then, many governments have described Israel’s response as disproportionate: the official death toll now exceeds 40,000 Palestinians killed, including over 15,000 children — some experts estimate the actual number to be over four times higher.\n\nFor more, read Global Voices’ previous Special Coverage: Israel’s war on Gaza\n\nThe assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas Political Bureau, in Tehran on 31 July 2024, and a key Hezbollah military commander in Beirut on 30 July have significantly escalated tensions in the region. These targeted killings, combined with the failure to implement a ceasefire, are raising the risk of a war that could engulf the whole region, with potentially far-reaching consequences for global peace and stability.\n\nIsrael’s actions, including its military occupation, settlement expansion, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and recurrent operations in Gaza and the West Bank, have drawn widespread accusations of human rights violations and defiance of international law. This includes an International Court of Justice (ICJ) initial ruling on an ongoing case finding it plausible that Israel is committing genocide and an application by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for arrest warrants against three Hamas leaders — including Haniyeh — and two Israeli officials — including Prime Minister Netanyahu — for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe arrest warrants include one for Mohammed Deif, Commander-in-Chief of Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. the Israeli army claims to have assassinated Deif in an airstrike on July 13 in the Al Mawasi humanitarian safe zone in Gaza — one that killed at least 90 people in a massacre described by United Nations official Scott Anderson as “some of the most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.”\n\nIsrael's military operations and targeted assassinations in neighboring countries continue despite United Nations Security Council resolutions, global calls for a ceasefire, and repeated condemnations from international humanitarian organizations who have labeled them as violations of international humanitarian law. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached catastrophic levels, with an illegal blockade that has led to severe shortages of vital supplies and the threat of a poliovirus outbreak, exacerbating the suffering of the population, with nine out of 10 people internally displaced, many of them multiple times.\n\nThe international community’s failure to enforce a ceasefire or hold Israel accountable has highlighted the limitations of global institutions in managing the crises. The United Nations has failed to mediate effectively, with its resolutions ignored, and global and regional players have not put pressure on Israel to accept or implement ceasefire resolutions adopted by the UNSC or proposed by mediators. This raises significant questions about the effectiveness of international law in protecting civilians in conflict zones.\n\nIn this special coverage, we explore the regional and global implications as well as the challenges facing international law in addressing the ongoing crisis.",

    "title": "How one community in Trinidad & Tobago pushed the culinary boundaries of pigeon peas",
    "text": "By Natalie Briggs\n\nWhen I first met Florence Warrick-Joseph, there were two things I didn’t know. One, we were related in that pumpkin vine way only Caribbean people can be. Two, the doubles I had just bought from her at a pop-up market had a surprise in them.\n\nIt wasn’t the comforting warmth of a bara hot out of the box, leaking through greaseproof paper. It wasn’t the silken tear of teeth into that just-fried pillowy goodness, which, if you’re lucky, will still hold a hint of the crackle of oil.\n\nNo, it wasn’t that.\n\nIt was the filling. Cucumber, check. Sweet sauce, check. The heady bouquet of garlic, cumin and spices was there. But there was something different in the mouth feel. It wasn’t the melt-in-your-mouth consistency of the channa that makes doubles a national byword in Trinidad and Tobago. Tasty, yes … but different.\n\nThe same bouquet is heavy in Warrick-Joseph’s small kitchen, tickling the nostrils, making me think about the last time I ate. “I don’t curry the peas. I stew it,” she revealed, while demonstrating how she puts her spin on the popular street food. This is not her only departure from the norm. The peas she uses? They are pigeon peas.\n\nThese days, it isn’t quite the record scratch moment it was when it first appeared — but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. What we should be discussing is how pigeon peas, the stuff of pelau and coconut milk stew-downs, ended up in doubles. It started as an exhortation to think outside the box.\n\nIn 2014, Warrick-Joseph, a retired registered nurse, decided to do an event management course. Her lecturer asked the cohort to stretch themselves beyond the ho-hummery of birthday parties and christenings for their practicum. She was an avid planter of pigeon peas, one of the many members of the Upper Cemetery Street Residents’ Association in Diego Martin, to do so. They had a bumper crop that year.\n\n“We were walking back down the hill,” Warrick-Joseph recalled. “Me, Errol [her husband] and Mr. Timothy. And he asked what were we going to do with all these peas. My husband said, ‘We will freeze it, we will sell it.’ Because that is what people do to get money to put in the organisation. So I said, thinking out of the box, we could have a pigeon peas festival.”\n\nThe two men were sceptical. Warrick-Joseph continued, “They were like, ‘Nobody ever heard of a pigeon peas festival.’ I said, ‘I’ve heard of a mango festival. I’ve heard of a breadfruit festival. There’s a chocolate festival. Why not pigeon peas?’”\n\nThe stage was set, but the main players were yet to arrive. They had the peas, but it would literally take a village to showcase their versatility. By the time the first festival rolled around in 2015, it was a result of a true community effort. They were able to generate so many recipes, including a version of doubles, that there were enough to fill a commemorative book.\n\n“We got someone to do pholourie,” Warrick-Joseph said. “We got somebody who could do pigeon peas accra. Everybody ended up taking a recipe. We found people in the community who could do these things. The pigeon peas roti was from a woman who did roti, and instead of using the dhal with the split peas, she used the pigeon peas.”\n\nPholourie? Accra? Roti? It wasn’t such a stretch of the imagination. After all, pigeon peas’ nutty, earthy flavour lends itself well to a variety of savoury preparations. That’s why it’s a perennial favourite across the Caribbean.\n\nBut Warrick-Joseph was about to hit me another curveball. That first festival, she came up with four of her own recipes. One for ice cream. One for a punch. One for a pigeon peas wine. Then one for a liqueur. Two of those are sweet. One of them officially qualifies as dessert. The trick was in picking, shelling and stewing the fresh pigeon peas to form the custard base all within 24 hours, while they were still full of flavour. My mind had more difficulty wrapping around the idea of pigeon peas as this creamy, cold concoction.\n\nThere were no such problems with the muffins. As I stood and watched her prepare them, different scents filled the kitchen, this time with her signature spice blend. It was the spice, I realised, that gave it the illusion of being sweet. I hadn’t seen her put a lot of sugar into the mixture. The eventual result was dense, reminding me more of a coconut drop than the traditional muffin with its cakey crumb. Fresh out of the oven, breaking into one was a treat; I could smell the spices wafting up from the steamy centre. There was nutmeg. Some cinnamon, too.\n\nNothing in the flavour screamed pigeon peas. That was more in the texture and the solidity with which it sat in my stomach. One muffin felt like a full meal, which led me to ask about the nutritional benefits of the pigeon peas substitution. I found out that, among other things, they were high in potassium and fibre, and were good for gut flora, diabetics, and women who wanted to lose weight.\n\nIn fact, it was trying to cater to customers who wanted healthier alternatives to doubles that prompted Warrick-Joseph to come up with a recipe for gluten-free bara, made with pigeon pea flour: “The reason for the switch was that people felt they wanted gluten-free. There was a group of people that was intolerant to normal flour.”\n\nThese were what I had really come to see her prepare, the muffins being a delectable side journey. I knew it would be different from the first doubles I had from her, since the bara in that one had been made the regular way, with flour, leavening agent and oil. How different this version would be, both in taste and feel, was left to be seen.\n\nIt was a three-flour mix, including the ground pigeon peas, which resulted in a tacky, sticky sort of dough that was allowed to rest for about half an hour. While it did that, Warrick-Joseph warmed the oil in which she would fry them later, and prepared the pigeon peas filling. We talked about many things while she did this, including her business and her plans to eventually have pre-packaged products in the supermarket.\n\nWhen she deemed the dough ready, she put the peas aside. The low gluten content made it difficult to handle as it tears easily, which is why she prefers to use a pastelle press to shape them, instead of rolling them out the traditional way. From there, the perfect circles went into the warmed oil, where they puff up slightly — nothing like the regular bara, because of the low gluten content. By the time they are done, I’m itching to try them.\n\nWarrick-Joseph presented them to me on a plate, complete with pigeon peas filling, cucumber and a tangy tamarind sweet sauce. I took a bite, and chewed slowly, trying to make up my mind about them. The verdict? All the elements were there. This tasted like doubles. Purists might draw the line at the bara, which was more reminiscent of a soft taco shell — flatter, with a slight, mealy crunch to it — while health enthusiasts might hail it as the thing to make doubles great again.",

    "title": "Meet Esther, an independent journalist reporting from the frontlines of Myanmar",
    "text": "Exile Hub is one of Global Voices’ partners in Southeast Asia, emerging in response to the 2021 coup in Myanmar, focusing on empowering journalists and human rights defenders. This edited article is republished under a content partnership agreement.\n\nMost people spend their lives running away from danger. Esther ran toward it.\n\nAfter finding refuge in Australia under UNHCR protection, she made the bold decision to return to the Thailand–Myanmar border in 2023 to continue her journalism. Now, in 2025, she reports from one of Myanmar’s most dangerous conflict zones often under fire, often uncertain of tomorrow. Yet she remains unshaken.\n\nIn a world where silence is safe, Esther chooses the frontline. Her weapon is truth, and she wields it for those who cannot.\n\nA journey against the current\n\nBorn in Mon State in 1993, Esther has always been someone who could not ignore injustice.\n\n“I have never been able to lie to myself or live in misery. If something doesn’t sit right with me, I have to face it head-on,” she reflects.\n\nLike many young people in Myanmar, Esther initially wandered through different jobs, unsure of her calling. She translated movies, worked as a travel and tour sales representative, and later became a public relations officer at a Korean company. But none of these roles felt right.\n\n“I couldn’t stay where I felt trapped or compromised,” she shares.\n\nHer turning point came in 2018 when she attended a basic journalism course. “That’s when I realized writing and sharing opinions was what I had always loved. It felt like home.” After the course ended, she landed her first journalism job at an ethnic media house.\n\nWhen the coup changed everything\n\nBy 2021, Esther was working with a major media house. When the coup hit, her newsroom relocated to Karenni State, and Esther went with them, continuing to report under dangerous conditions. But even after escaping to Australia for safety, the pull of truth was stronger than comfort. In 2023, she made the decision to return.\n\nA few months after she arrived in Thailand, the military made a desperate announcement. In February 2024, the military reactivated its conscription law, mandating that men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 serve in the army. Evading service or helping someone evade could lead to five years in prison.\n\n“As the number of these conscription stories grew, so did my determination to report them,” Esther recalls. But working as an exiled independent journalist came with its own struggles. With no regular income and the constant need for resources, continuing her work was a challenge. That’s when she applied for Exile Hub’s Critical Voices Fellowship 2024 and received it.\n\nBearing witness on the frontlines\n\nEsther began collecting stories from those most affected. She spoke with young men who had fled their villages, fearful of being conscripted. She also interviewed women who had watched brothers and husbands taken by the army, leaving families uncertain and anxious about their loved ones’ fate.\n\nIn September 2024, she published “I Don’t Want Others to Face What I Faced: Stories of Forced Military Conscription,” giving a voice to those the regime wanted silenced.\n\nLater, she followed with another hard-hitting piece, “Snatched from Their Beds, Taken on the Streets — The Young Men in Myanmar Forced to Fight the Junta’s Losing War.”\n\nToday, Esther works deep inside one of Myanmar’s most volatile conflict zones, a place where the sound of gunfire and the threat of airstrikes are constant. Despite the risks, she is satisfied with witnessing the truth with her eyes and documenting and reporting on it.\n\nEsther is more than a journalist. She is a lifeline for those whose cries would otherwise vanish in the dark. And no matter the risk, she will keep writing and keep reporting, because for her, silence is never an option.",

    "text": "Environmental groups initiated global activities and protests from September 18 to 21 to drumbeat the call for urgent climate action amid the worsening pollution and continuing deterioration of the natural ecosystem. The series of protests were held right before the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and less than six weeks away from the UN Climate Summit (COP30) in Brazil.\n\nIn Asia, the “Draw the Line” campaign highlighted the demand to phase out fossil fuels, build renewables, shift to sustainable food, and prioritize the people’s basic needs over corporate interests.\n\nSeveral countries participated in the campaign led by a network of environmental groups and community-based organizations.\n\nIn the Philippines, the campaign was actively supported by local groups resisting projects and policies that threaten the lives and livelihoods of rural and coastal communities. A fluvial protest was organized in the town of Culasi in Antique province, located in the Visayas islands of the Philippines, to call attention to the demand of the small fisherfolk against the entry of commercial fishing operations in municipal waters. Javie Barcinal of 350.org Asia echoed the stand of small fishers.\n\nSmall fishers are among the worst affected by the climate crisis, with warming seas resulting in dwindling catches each year. To make matters worse, the government has allowed industrial fishing to encroach into municipal waters. This exacerbates climate injustice that small fishers experience as hunger for their families.\n\nIn Indonesia, environmnetalists organized at least 36 actions in 34 cities and provinces across the country on September 18, to push for bold reforms in government policies. A march was held towards the State Palace on September 19 as rallyists reiterated the anti-corruption demands of the youth-led protests that erupted in the country last month. Sisilia Nurmala Dewi of 350.org Indonesia led climate advocates in asserting an end to corruption to fund a better future.\n\nWe draw the line as flash floods drown the innocent, while people’s voices against government failures are being silenced. Oligarchs and polluters have ruled this country for far too long, taking public money for climate action and destroying natural resources that should be preserved for future generations. We demand real, decisive action. President Prabowo must honor his promises by committing to 100 percent renewable energy in 10 years and a clear immediate plan to phase-out coal plants.\n\nPaskah Toga of Climate Rangers Bali cited the recent flooding disaster in Bali island to rally public opposition against fossil-based power plants.\n\nThe recent deadly floods in Bali is clear evidence that the climate crisis is no longer a distant threat but a reality that needs to be resolved with concrete policies. The government must stop building fossil-based power plants and phase out fossil fuels.\n\nIn Japan, protesters challenged the new leadership to phase out fossil fuels and to reverse policies that blame immigrants for the country’s social woes. Masayoshi Iyoda, 350.org Japan campaigner, summed up their demand.\n\nWe draw the line on Japan’s rising contributions to climate chaos and war. As we experience both flash floods and extreme heat, workers suffer and food prices continue to soar. Japan’s new leadership must show political will to phase out fossil fuels and shift to 100% renewables, instead of going with the far-right tide of blaming immigrants for our economic woes and backsliding on climate action.\n\nThe protest was also attended by activists who expressed solidarity with Palestinians by condemning the continuous bombings and military attacks in Gaza.\n\nIn South Korea, Jiyun Gim of the Green Environment Youth Korea urged authorities to comply with the planned emissions reduction this year.\n\nSouth Korea’s 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) will be determined in November. We are drawing the line to prevent South Korea from setting a climate goal that falls below 60% emissions reduction. This is not just about numbers—it is the survival line for future generations. The government must set ambitious, science-based, and future-oriented climate targets.\n\nIn Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh, community residents staged an action denouncing the planned revival of a coal plant. Shahrukh Karim, a youth leader in Matarbari, articulated the sentiments of the local community.\n\nWe are burning, our lands are dying, and our rivers are drying up. We draw the line on building another coal plant, when the existing one has already driven away thousands of families and turned our homes into a wasteland. This needs to stop.\n\nCommunities Draw the Line on Matarbari Coal Plant 2 Revival https://t.co/2IT1VPkF5P pic.twitter.com/9E05xBK9xV — Energy & Power (@enpbd) September 20, 2025\n\nIn an email interview with Global Voices, 350.org Asia Communications Manager Ilang-Ilang Quijano shared their initial plans on how to sustain the campaign.",

    "title": "Africa charts bold path towards green inclusive development at the second Africa Climate Summit",
    "text": "Over 6,000 delegates gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, for the second Africa Climate Summit (ACS2), held from September 8 to 10, to search for Africa-driven solutions ahead of negotiations for the United Nations 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the world's largest annual environmental conference.\n\nThe second Africa Climate Summit was organized to unite African leaders, youth, and partners in pushing for fair climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s role as a solutions hub, while preparing a common position ahead of COP30 negotiations. It was a pivotal moment for Africa to stake its claim as a leader in the global climate conversation. Leaders, activists, and young innovators came together to push for reforms in climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s youth voices. The gathering was themed around “Accelerating Global Climate Solutions: Financing for Africa’s Resilient and Green Development.” Ethiopia’s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, opened the event with a keynote that set the tone:\n\nAfrica should not be seen only as a victim of climate challenges, but as a continent of solutions and innovations that could guide the world forward.\n\nHe also proposed the “Africa Climate Innovation Compact” to produce 1,000 innovators by 2030, financed and owned by Africans.\n\nThis vision was built on the momentum of the inaugural summit in Nairobi in 2023, which, importantly, was preceded by the African Youth Climate Assembly (AYCA). By doing so, organizers ensured that the majority-youth population of Africa was not just represented but central to shaping the conversation.\n\nThe challenges Africa faces\n\nAfrica continues to wrestle with the painful legacy of historical injustice and the harsh reality of a deepening climate crisis. Despite contributing the least to global emissions, the continent feels the impacts most acutely. Climate finance remains painfully inadequate as wealthy nations have consistently fallen short of their yearly pledge, and African countries today pay back about five times more in debt servicing than they receive in climate aid.\n\nThe cost of this imbalance is causing hospitals to stretch beyond capacity as diseases like malaria and cholera spread more widely under shifting climatic conditions. Crops are failing under the weight of prolonged droughts or sudden floods, leaving farmers with empty fields and families without food. Coastal cities, from Lagos to Dar es Salaam, face rising waters that sweep away homes, businesses, and livelihoods.\n\nYet at the same time, Africa holds some of the richest renewable resources on the planet. If harnessed, its solar capacity alone could power the world many times over. Africa holds 17 percent of the world’s population but receives just 3 percent of global climate investment. Restrictive financial systems and predatory loan arrangements often force African countries back into reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nEcoVista, a youth-led ecological justice movement whose main focus is on climate justice and the environment, based in Nairobi, Kenya posted on its X account:\n\nFossil fuels are the biggest driver of the climate crisis, responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. #MakeThemPay\n\nDraw The Line pic.twitter.com/N9aUDWl8e8 — EcoVistaKe (@EcoVistaKE) September 19, 2025\n\nLayered on top of that is a painful reminder of colonial history. While Africa’s minerals powered industrial growth in the Global North, the continent was left behind with ecological damage and struggling economies. Yearly natural disasters including cyclones, floods, and expanding deserts displace millions every year, and pushed African leaders at ACS2 to adopt the Addis Ababa Declaration, a clear and urgent call for change.\n\nWith regard to the consequences facing Africa, Tangwa Abilu, a Cameroonian Climate and Environmental Activist, shared on X :\n\nThe horn of Africa is grieving because their\n\n-Their farms are no longer yielding\n\n-Advancement of desert is alarming\n\n-Our major rivers are drying\n\n-Proliferation of pest and pathogens\n\n-Development of tropical diseases.\n\n-Our crop are dieing out.\n\nClimate change is a reality. pic.twitter.com/2MQ5fZG1Zo — Tangwa Abilu.🌿🌏🌾🍀🍃.SDG's. (@AbiluTangwa) December 29, 2024\n\nIn the same context, K. Diallo, an African author, drew attention to the damage caused by floods in December 2023. He posted on his X account:\n\nflood disaster in the DR Congo is a result of global warming meeting a failed state…..The global South bears more than 95% of the costs and deaths related to climate change despite making up less than 5% of consumption-based cumulative emissions above 350ppm CO2. pic.twitter.com/vTDobNNVl5 — K.Diallo ☭ (@nyeusi_waasi) December 31, 2023\n\nDemands ahead of COP30\n\nFor African leaders, climate finance must shift from symbolic promises to meaningful reparations. They argue that financing should come as debt-free grants rather than loans that deepen dependency. Historic polluters owe this to frontline communities losing their farms to drought or their homes to rising seas. The Loss and Damage Fund, in particular, needs to prioritize these vulnerable communities with direct, rapid assistance: cash for families in sinking villages, support for starved farmlands, and investment in healthcare for climate-induced trauma. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said:\n\nToo often, Africa's story begins with what we lack: finance, technology, time. Let us instead begin with what we have: the youngest population in the world, vast solar resources, and the resilience to build a new climate economy.\n\nLeaders are also demanding stronger commitments from rich nations. During last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries from the global north pledged to pay USD300 billion in climate finance, but the amount falls far short of the USD1.3 trillion per year needed by African nations, who need it to effectively adapt and transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nACS2 came at a crucial moment when the Lake Chad Basin, which once supported millions across Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic, had shrunk by over 90 percent. With it, the livelihoods of countless families have evaporated. Africa is both the most vulnerable to climate collapse and one of the most promising centers for climate solutions. As the world heads towards COP30 in Brazil in November, Africans say they do not just want to be heard, but are demanding to be recognized as solution builders and shapers of the planet’s shared future.",

    "title": "The legacy of ‘sponge cities’ left by Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian",
    "text": "Yu Kongjian (俞孔坚), 62, the Chinese landscape architect who pioneered the concept of “sponge cities,” died in a plane crash in the Pantanal region, the largest tropical wetland in the world, in Brazil, on September 23, 2025. Three other people also died during the accident: pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, and filmmakers Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., who were both working with Yu to create a documentary about sponge cities. The cause of the crash is under investigation.\n\nFerraz’s work focused on nonfiction productions, including a series about the 2016 plane crash involving the Brazilian football team, Chapecoense. Crispim Jr. worked on projects such as a documentary about Brazilian architect Vilanova Artigas and another about the first women’s football national team in Brazil.\n\nBrazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, posted condolences on his X account and highlighted Yu's work:\n\nFoi com tristeza e consternação que recebi a notícia do desastre aéreo ocorrido no Pantanal no início da noite desta terça-feira, 23. A tragédia, infelizmente, custou as vidas do piloto Marcelo Pereira de Barros, dos documentaristas Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz e Rubens… — Lula (@LulaOficial) September 24, 2025\n\nIt was with sadness and consternation that I received the news about the aircraft disaster that happened in the Pantanal regional, early Tuesday night, the 23rd. The tragedy, unfortunately, took the lives of the pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, documentarians Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., and the Chinese architect Kongjian Yu. In times of climate change, Kongjian Yu became a world reference for sponge cities, which unite life quality and environment protection: something we want — and need — for the future. To all the victims’ friends, family and coworkers, I leave my deepest sorrows.\n\nYu’s legacy\n\nYu was in Brazil to work on a documentary, but he had also recently attended the São Paulo International Architecture Biennale, which was themed “EXTREMES — Architectures for an overheated planet.” Raquel Schenkman, the Institute of Brazilian Architects’ president, responsible for the Biennale’s organization, told G1 Yu was “someone on the frontline of transformations in big urban centers facing climate change.”\n\nOn its website, the Biennale published a note saying that, as the “creator of the theory of sponge cities, Yu Kongjian left a monumental legacy, also urgent to face climate crisis in cities,” and that his work, based on ecosystemic principles, “showed in a practical and poetic way how the landscape can be a vital infrastructure to urban resilience, integrating man to nature in a sustainable way.”\n\nSponge cities concept\n\nYu’s main legacy is designing and implementing projects based on his sponge cities theory. A professor at Peking University, his “sponge city” concept became a top national priority in China in 2013, following the massive floods in the Beijing region in 2012, which left 79 people dead and tens of thousands displaced. He also founded Turenscape, one of the main landscape architecture firms in the world, based in China.\n\nYu cautioned against overly “grey” cities that rely too much on concrete and asphalt, which disrupt natural water pathways and prevent the ground from absorbing water. While conventional water management focuses on draining water through engineered drainage infrastructure, such as pipes and water channels, sponge cities rely on techniques such as green roofs, rainwater storage and infiltration systems, sunken green spaces, permeable pavement, bioretention ponds, wetland revitalization, restoring natural waterflow pathways, and more.\n\n“Floods are not enemies,” Yu explained in an interview with WeForum. “We can make friends with floods. We can make friends with water.”\n\nYu’s approach to urban planning has been successfully implemented in dozens of cities in China, particularly after Chinese President Xi Jinping established his thoughts on ecological civilization in 2018.\n\nIn the past decade, his natural landscape approach is becoming an important tool in city planning and water management around the world.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, where recurring extreme weather events routinely cause massive floods that displace hundreds of thousands, many city planners are looking to sponge cities as a potential solution for unprecedented levels of rainfall.\n\nSo far, the concept has mostly been implemented on a small scale in individual neighborhoods, streets, or areas, meaning its flood mitigation impacts are often limited to the local level, rather than city- or nationwide.\n\nOn X, Zhongshan city's tourism promotion outlet, commemorates Yu's death by highlighting one of his landscape projects in the southern Chinese city:\n\nOn September 23 (Brazilian time), Professor Yu Kongjian from the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at #Peking University, tragically passed away in a plane crash at the age of 62. Professor Yu had won numerous world-class #design awards, including the Oberlander Prize and the John Cobb Common Good Award. Among his representative works is the #QijiangPark in #Zhongshan, #Guangdong . This #park, transformed from the site of a former shipyard, opened in 2001 and quickly gained global attention, winning several domestic and international design awards. In designing and building the park, Professor Yu and his team preserved the original industrial relics, such as shipyard machinery, docks, and other structures, and repurposed them with new functions. [original English version from @Amzhongshan]\n\nYu himself acknowledged that scaling up the pilot projects in Chinese cities was challenging. One of his sponge city projects in Zhengzhou faced backlash after a severe flood in 2021, which claimed 12 lives in the city, prompting many to express doubts about the practicality of his idea. Moreover, as China's coastal regions are highly industrialized, they demand cross-departmental collaboration, strong political will, and extensive administrative coordination to restore concrete riverbanks and seawalls to wetlands.\n\nIn an interview with Brazilian news outlet G1, Yu said that on a scale of 1 to 10, his optimism regarding the world’s chances of reversing climate change ranked 4. He also mentioned water scarcity — one of the challenges his projects aimed to address — as the primary issue humanity will face over the next 25 years.\n\nA journalist living in China, Isabela Shi, shared Yu Kongjian’s last update on a Chinese social media platform:\n\n🕯️No último vídeo que o arquiteto chinês Yu Kongjian divulgou na rede social chinesa, ele estava mostrando a viagem a Pantanal com equipa brasileira que tenta refletir sobre Planeta Esponja através de encolhimento de zonas húmidas. “Wonderful, amazing”, encantou ele pro Brasil. pic.twitter.com/fKn5ZKgIwe — Isabela Shi🇨🇳🇧🇷 (@ShiIsabela) September 25, 2025",

    "title": "How a comics school taught perseverance and creative freedom in Bosnia & Herzegovina",
    "text": "This article by Adin Kadrić first appeared in Balkan Diskurs on September 12, 2025. An edited version is being republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement with the Post-Conflict Research Center (PCRC).\n\nEditor's note: Zenica is a city in the middle of Bosnia and Herzegovina with about 100,000 residents. It is noted for its ironworks industry as well as being home to one of the big prisons in ex-Yugoslavia, described in the cult rock song Zenica Blues. It is not often considered when speaking about art, making the significance of this initiative — which began during the war of 1992-1995 and still persists to this day — even more extraordinary.\n\nFor over 30 years, the Zenica School of Comics has been not only an illustration school but a symbol of perseverance, cultural resistance, and lasting dedication to art. Initially conceived as an escape from the repression of the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and later, a platform for expression and creativity, the school has trained around 200 young artists. About 70 of them have gone on to become prominent young authors, whose works have left a mark on the domestic and regional comics scene.\n\nSeveral graduates are even acclaimed beyond the borders of their country, with Kenan Halilović, Biljana Šafaražik, and Zdravko Cvjetković being some of the most prominent. While the school has been synonymous with quality and creativity within the domestic comic scene for years, the international acclaim for these artists’ work underscores the fact that Zenica maintains a firm foothold in this visual medium.\n\nRecalling its beginnings, Adnadin Jašarević, the school’s founder and director of the Zenica City Museum, said that its primary goal was to give children a creative escape from the harsh realities of war. Under such conditions, comics were like Alice in Wonderland — providing an escape from hunger, fear, and shelling. An average of ten students still pass through the school every year, learning how to translate their thoughts, fears, and hopes into dynamic sequences of frames and speech clouds.\n\nNewer names like Filip Andronik, Milorad Vicanović, Senad Mavrić, and Enis Čišić represent the contemporary wave of comic artists from BiH. They actively cooperate with renowned publishers from the United States and Europe, demonstrating that despite its underdeveloped infrastructure, Bosnia and Herzegovina has comic creators who can stand equally alongside the best talent the genre has to offer.\n\nPublications such as “Horostop,” “ZE strip,” “EKO strip” and “SUV – Steps in Time” were created at the Zenica School, showcasing both its longevity and its dedication to comic culture. Explaining that the students themselves choose the topics they work on according to their own interests, Jašarević noted that he has “never stopped working” to ensure that comics remain a tool for expression and creative release.\n\nAs far as technology’s impact on the comic industry goes, Jašarević explained that while comics used to be widely available to the masses, they are now becoming a far more exclusive product, with expensive integral editions and albums intended for a small but loyal audience. While the idea behind ​​comics as a liberating medium remains the same, the development of technology has heralded a turn in modern-day comic production.\n\nCartoonist and former Zenica student Zdravko Cvjetković, in speaking about the impact of technology, emphasized that smart tablets have made drawing easier and faster for many artists, without compromising the quality of their work. However, he warned that AI tools — such as those used for generating text and images — pose serious ethical and aesthetic questions.\n\nHe believes that the mass availability of tools that produce images and stories in seconds, threatens to trivialize art and blur the line between creativity and automation: “If we all become artists just because we have a tool in our pocket, then nobody is really an artist.”\n\nMany things about comics today, according to Cvjetković, are drastically different than before the war: “Comics are no longer accessible to such a wide audience, especially children. They’re too expensive and rarely found in newsstands.”\n\nThe burgeoning Bosnian comics scene\n\nPointing out that children today reach for screens before print media like comics or books, Cvjetković said that publishers are therefore targeting older generations who grew up with comics.\n\nA positive outcome of this is the growing number of comics festivals in the region, which promote a culture of reading and drawing. “Workshops and comics contests for children [are] an almost mandatory part of every serious festival,” Cvjetković emphasized, “and this is crucial in the absence of comics schools like the one in Zenica.”\n\nComics culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina persists despite its modest ecosystem, in which there is almost no institutional support, and few major publishers or specialized festivals. However, thanks to the enthusiasm of individuals, the scene is not disappearing; in fact, it is quietly but steadily growing.\n\nAuthors like Berin Tuzlić and Enis Čišić have been representing BiH on the regional and international comics scene for years. Tuzlić, known for his experimental approach and multimedia projects, combines comics with music and animation. Čišić, who also tried his hand at Marvel productions, represents a more contemporary, technically precise form of expression. Their work shows that the country is producing talent capable of competing globally.\n\nIsmet Erdić also holds a special place on the BiH comics scene, with his rare combination of historical storytelling and visual narration in comics about Kulin Ban and medieval Bosnia. His work has educational value and is often used in classrooms, which makes him one of the few authors whose comics reach the general public.\n\nDespite unfavorable conditions for comic distribution, publicity, and marketing, comics culture in BiH is still preserved as a niche interest by enthusiasts. Social networks, web comics, and regional cooperation with authors from Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia are currently key to their survival. So, while relatively small, the BiH comics scene has an authentic flair and great potential, waiting for better times ahead.",

    "title": "Civil society initiative fights for equal education opportunities in Togo",
    "text": "In Togo, a national initiative built on civic solidarity helps relieve parents’ yearly back-to-school expenses.\n\nEducation is free and compulsory throughout the country, with a population of over 9.5 million. Following a two-month break (from mid-July to mid-September), more than 3 million students returned to school this month. While the authorities continue to work on improving education through teacher training and recruitment, investing in renovations and school infrastructure, the parents’ main priority is seeing their children succeed at the end of each school year.\n\nOver the years, there has been a marked increase in the gross enrollment rate and the proportion of Togolese students completing the school year. In April 2025, the local news website Lechiquier published:\n\n…le taut brut de scolarisation au primaire dépasse 100%. Il était de l’ordre de 111,70% en 2023, 116,70% en 2024 et une prévision de 116,20% pour l’année 2025. Dans le même sillage, le taux d’achèvement du primaire a évolué de 88,80% en 2023 à 94,60% en 2024. Pour l’année 2025, le gouvernement table sur une augmentation de 121,70%.\n\nThe gross primary school enrolment rate now exceeds 100 percent. In 2023, it was approximately 111.70 percent, in 2024 it was 116.70 percent, and 116.20 percent is forecast for 2025. Similarly, the primary school completion rate increased from 88.80 percent in 2023 to 94.60 percent in 2024. For 2025, the government forecasts an increase to 121.70 percent.\n\nThis rate of over 100 percent is due to it far exceeding the initial estimated value.\n\nFree school education\n\nTogo is one of five African countries with high enrollment rates in school, an impressive development stemming from the various reforms the authorities have implemented in the education sector. In 2008, Togo introduced free pre-school and primary education in the public sector. Since the beginning of the 2021–2022 school year, education in public secondary schools has also been free, a measure the authorities will maintain for the 2025–2026 school year.\n\nThese measures help combat inequities in accessing education. However, efforts, such as providing student school kits (notebooks, books, pens, pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, and school bags), are still required to tackle inequality and ensure universal coverage.\n\nTogo’s guaranteed monthly minimum wage (SMIG) increased from FCFA 35,000 (USD 64) in 2012 to FCFA 52,500 (USD 95) in early 2023. Although this measure was introduced to support the Togolese working population of over 4 million, not all are content with its implementation, condemning the country’s ongoing poor economic situation and challenging living conditions.\n\nAssociation contributions\n\nGiven the financial crisis, parents’ biggest concern is purchasing back-to-school supplies and kits. However, Togolese civil society provides solutions. Citizens, both young and old, are quick to lend their support to help parents meet these expenses.\n\nNumerous citizens, working as part of various associations, travel to the country’s villages and remote areas, assisting and supporting children, especially the most vulnerable. These efforts are a social and solidarity-based alternative to the associations committed to child protection, education, and development.\n\nOne example is Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (the Togolese Child Protection Association or LTPE). On August 29, 2025, LTPE supported 5,000 children from 12 villages of the Amou Prefecture in the Plateaux region.\n\nLe 29 août 2025, plus de 5 000 enfants de la préfecture d’Amou venus de 12 localités différentes ont reçu des kits scolaires grâce à l’initiative « Éducation pour tous : 1 élève, 1 kit, 1 choix de vie » portée par la #LTPE. pic.twitter.com/LMroVuE9oY — Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (@LTPE_ONG) August 30, 2025\n\nOn August 29, 2025, more than 5,000 children from 12 different locations in the Amou Prefecture received school kits through the #LTPE initiative ‘Education for All: One student, one kit, one life choice.’\n\nIn an interview with Togolese media outlet Plume d'Afrique, Nina Afi Kazoulé, the LTPE coordinator, explained the scope of this measure:\n\nNous voulons par cette action éviter le décrochage scolaire. Et nous savons que le décrochage scolaire peut être dû à l'incapacité financière des parents, aux grossesses en milieu scolaire, bref à tous les comportements qui ne sont pas appropriés à adopter par un apprenant.\n\nWe want to prevent school dropouts with this measure. We know that school dropouts can happen due to the parents’ lack of financial resources, pregnancies among school girls, or any inappropriate student behavior\n\nIn the village of Zooti N'titikope, Vogan, a town 45 kilometers northwest of the Togolese capital Lomé, the Togovi Bé Sourire association and Action for Peace and Good Governance (APGG) joined forces with several other associations on September 5 and 6 to support young learners. More than 300 vulnerable children received school kits, and 20 young girls will be monitored and supported in successfully reintegrating into school.\n\nLomé also has vulnerable children supported by other groups, including the Premiers Pas pour l’Enfance (First Steps for Children or 3PE) association. Its mission is to promote equal education opportunities through solidarity initiatives, such as the payment of school fees and supply provision for children. Association President Akilou Demon told media outlet Ledefenseur:\n\nNous voulons que tous les enfants aient accès à l’éducation, car l’enfant a droit à l’école. Si certains en sont privés, ce n’est pas juste. Notre ambition est de leur donner une chance égale de réussir et de contribuer demain au développement de notre patrie.\n\nAs children have the right to attend school, we want all children to have access to education. Some are deprived, and this is not fair. We aim to give them equal opportunities to succeed and one day contribute to our country’s development.\n\nAlthough the results of various reforms are visible, shortcomings remain in Togo’s education system.\n\nSchool infrastructure, such as classrooms, is substandard, especially in villages. Students study in straw huts with few school benches (supplemented in some places with bricks) and are forced to move or interrupt their lessons due to adverse weather conditions. In 2021, these circumstances led to construction plans for 30,000 classrooms equipped with wooden class benches. However, in September 2024, the government reduced its improvement projects by more than half, going from 30,000 classrooms to just 14,632.\n\nWhile civil society can offset some of the education system’s shortcomings, it’s ultimately up to the state, which declared education free and compulsory, to improve education quality and train new teachers to achieve equal opportunities for all Togolese children.",

    "title": "In Brazil, Romani people living in peripheral areas fight for recognition of their identities",
    "text": "This article, written by Artur Ferreira and Amanda Oliveira, was originally published on May 30, 2025, on the Agência Mural website. An edited version is published on Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nIn the collective imagination, the Romani people are associated with colourful clothing, parties, accessories, and an aura of mystery, embodying a wandering spirit. But beyond the stereotypes, there is a rich history of resistance and belonging that spans centuries, including in Brazil, in the outskirts of São Paulo.\n\nIn universities, public offices, doctors’ offices, or their traditional campsites, they are fighting for their rights, against prejudice, and for recognition in a country where there are still shortcomings in caring for the diversity of these communities.\n\nIn Itaim Paulista, a neighbourhood at the eastern end of the city, 250 people live in one of the main and oldest Romani campsites in the region.\n\n“Some Romanies palm read, dance, get dressed up in traditional clothing, but some are even evangelical, like myself, and they don’t all even live in camps. We are a people like any other,” the 32-year-old housewife Magda Santos says. She has been living in the camps for eight years with her husband and two children. “I am not Romani by blood, but I became one when I got married to one.”\n\nThe Romani, also known as the Roma peoples, are an ethnic group that doesn’t have a single origin. One of the more widely accepted theories is that they are of Indian origin but have travelled the world since the 11th century in a great diaspora, dispersing throughout the Balkans, Western Europe, and later to other continents.\n\nWhile she was hanging clothes on the clothesline, 29-year-old seamstress Viviane Alves Pereira made sure to find an answer when asked about the main problems her people face. The statement came without hesitation: prejudice, invisibility and the lack of access to basic rights, a common scenario in marginalized neighbourhoods.\n\nWho are the Roma people from the outskirts?\n\nThe majority of Romani who live on the outskirts of Greater São Paulo are of the Calon ethnicity, like Magda and Viviane. They are also those who suffer the most prejudice relating to maintaining their traditions and being most recognized as “gypsies” (a term now considered derogatory), because of their clothing and their nomadic lifestyle, according to sources from this report.\n\nIn Brazil, there are two other Romani ethnic groups: the Roma and the Sinti peoples. They don’t wear traditional clothing, so they mostly go unnoticed in the cities.\n\n“Many Brazilians were already cared for by doctors, nurses and Romani lawyers, and maybe they don’t even know,” states activist Nicolas Ramanush, 64, who is the president of the NGO, Romani Embassy of Brazil (Embaixada Cigana do Brasil), in Santo André in the Greater São Paulo area.\n\n“In the region, Romani people were concentrated in the neighborhood of Itaim Paulista and in the cities of Itaquaquecetuba and Itapevi, with camps near the train stations,” he says.\n\nEach ethnicity is divided into subgroups, and each one develops its own customs, habits, religions and rituals. “In my ethnic group, for example, we always wear decorated shoes with a lot of details. Some Calon women are famous for their flowery dresses and for using handkerchiefs,” says Ramanush, who belongs to the Sinti ethnicity.\n\nThis group has the fewest number of people in the country. “Today, if there are 100 families in Brazil, it is a lot,” says Ramanush. “This is because of the period of Nazism. The Sintis were almost exterminated. Among the Romani killed during the Holocaust, the majority were Sinti and Roma,” he adds.\n\nRamanush notes that many aspects of Romani culture are integrated into the Brazilian lifestyle without most people realizing it. They were among those responsible for helping Carnival to grow, especially in the northeast, creating Carnival street blocks. Certain costumes, such as “La Ursa” (The Bear) in Recife, have a Romani origin.\n\n“Instruments like the seven or six-string guitar were brought to Brazil by the Roma people. Some samba dancers spoke about how living with the Romanies inspired them musically,” Ramanush says.\n\nUnder the canvas tents\n\nNomadic and outskirt-dwelling Romani have a routine defined by difficulties surrounding education for their children and lack of healthcare, caused by the lack of a stable address. They also face São Paulo’s structural problems, such as floods, and living under canvas tents, without safety.\n\nOne of the most impactful natural disasters was the flooding in February 2025 in the far east of São Paulo, in the region known as Jardim Pantanal. The streets and houses remained underwater for several days. The Romani in these camps had to face that situation under the tents.\n\n“We spent days underwater, and it was the neighbors from the region who helped us,” Santos remembers with outrage.\n\nThe camp’s inhabitants had to deal with a lack of drinking water; tents were affected, and according to local accounts, they had to make a joint effort to avoid major losses of furniture and appliances while the flooding advanced.\n\nJust like Santos, Ramanush believes that the first step to improving the Romani community’s life in the outskirts of Brazil is for them not to be invisible.\n\nPrejudice and invisibility\n\nEven with initiatives such as the National Day of Roma Peoples, commemorated every May 24 since 2006, some rights are still neglected. For example, Romani people are not recognized in the national census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).\n\nSantos remembers the difficulty she faced in registering her children’s ethnic group in their identity documents. Since there is no official recognition of “Romani” ethnicity, she ended up registering them by their skin color.\n\n“There are policies catered to Indigenous peoples, Black and Brown people, but not for Romani people. We have our own culture, but we do not show up, which is why I say being Romani is being invisible,” she claims.\n\nRamanush experienced a similar situation when a census taker visited him during the most recent census in Brazil in 2022. “She asked me what my race was, and I answered that it was not on the list. My complexion is white, but I’m a Romani.”\n\nIBGE estimates that Brazil has between 800,000 and a million Romani, but the Roma groups believe the numbers are higher.\n\n“I've already travelled all over Brazil meeting Romani people from all ethnic groups. Without official data, there are no efficient public policies,” Ramanush explains. “Even to count how many Romani there are in each city or town, local governments make the process difficult.”\n\nBesides the lack of recognition, Romani people living in peripheral areas also face a prejudice that runs through generations. They have been accused of theft, robbery, and deception for centuries. It wasn’t rare to have them associated with kidnapping children.\n\nTrying to change this reality and fight prejudice, Romani groups have been mobilized for the approval of a bill making teaching Romani culture and history in schools mandatory — modeling what already happens with Black and Indigenous people in Brazil. The proposal presented by federal deputy Helder Salomão (PT, Workers’ Party), at the Chamber of Deputies as Bill 3547 of 2015, has made little progress.\n\nIn their justification, the text reinforces the idea that for centuries Romani groups have been experiencing prejudice, marginalization, exclusion and persecution. So, the bill aims to “change the image of Romani populations, trying to reduce prejudice and discrimination that these groups are subjected to.”\n\nThe bill also asserts that providing visibility for Romani groups “will provide a more fertile ground to build public policies focusing on the promotion of human rights.”",

    "text": "This article was published by Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand. An edited version has been republished by Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement.\n\nBetween July and May 2025, tensions between Thailand and Cambodia over a border dispute devolved into violence that left at least 43 dead on both sides, dozens injured, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Despite signing a ceasefire agreement on July 28, hostility has remained deeply embedded in both countries, fueled by misinformation. Amidst the turmoil, Cambodians and Thais have come together to launch a cross-border campaign aimed at combating hatred and promoting empathy and lasting peace.\n\nThailand and Cambodia share over 700 kilometres of border, where several undemarcated sections have been long-standing sources of conflict between the two countries, since the Preah Vihear dispute beginning in the 1950s, to this year when clashes broke out on May 28th and led to fatalities on July 24th. On top of that, the countries also share historical and cultural ties, which have complicated the tensions between them, leading to deep-rooted hostility between the two peoples.\n\nHostility skyrocketed after the July 24 armed conflict as the conflict between the two governments trickled down to all facets of society. Cambodian and Thai netizens traded accusations on who initiated the clashes.\n\n“We see all the problems start to unfold, and when hatreds, prejudice, and discrimination on people’s level have gone online, it was even more devastating for us, and that's why we decided to come together on the Cambodian side to rally among ourselves,” said Lim Solinn, a Cambodian social activist and artist. She later reached out to friends in Thailand in different places and then stumbled upon a group of Thai people who are a network of solidarity.\n\nOu Tepphallin, a Cambodian labor rights activist and campaign co-organizer, said she joined the campaign to address the suffering of migrant workers and communities caught in the crossfire of recent tensions, particularly Cambodian workers in Thailand and Thai workers in Cambodia.\n\nThey faced physical violence and racism, and they were living with fear, so their voices were unheard. On top of that, children living along the border have lost opportunities to study due to the closure of border crossings. Family members were separated, such as a child whose mother was in Thailand but whose father was in Phnom Penh, and they have no idea when they can be reunited.\n\nIn addition, according to the Thai authorities, the conflict since July 24th has also caused over 500,000 Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand to return home, since most of them felt unsafe and threatened in Thailand. This has left Thailand with a significant labor shortage as Cambodian migrants typically played an essential role in the country's agricultural industry.\n\nSolinn stated that both Thai and Cambodian campaign organizers want the campaign to go viral in both countries and send messages to leaders saying, “Please don't use violence on Cambodian or Thai migrant workers.”\n\nThe campaigners are also trying to figure out catchy ways for this campaign to go viral and reach regular Thais and Cambodians. The campaign includes writing poems and making songs, which they believe could help calm people and encourage them not to hate simply because of what they heard or saw on the news.\n\n“We’re just starting, even if the war ends tomorrow, the hatred continues, so we need to continue this work and reach out to more communities in Cambodia and in Thailand,” said Solinn.\n\nPhallin added that it's time to heal those who suffered from both sides, and that is what the campaign did by starting to send healing messages to ordinary people.\n\nWhen hatred is louder than empathy\n\nIn Thailand, when the armed conflict erupted and innocent Thai civilians and military personnel were killed, many Thai netizens demanded tit for tat retaliation. In addition, right-wing influencers have threatened Cambodian migrant workers and called on patriots to use violence against them.\n\nOften, those who oppose this and call for a peaceful approach face condemnation online for being too optimistic or unpatriotic.\n\n“All the ordinary Cambodians want nothing but peace and harmony with our neighbours, and a lot of people get caught in between these polarizations, and because of the level of their vulnerability, they cannot get their voices heard at all,” noted Solinn.\n\nOn the Cambodian side, Solinn remarked that while they wanted peace and for this war to stop, most Cambodians also became enraged and emotional when they saw news about civilians being affected, schools being bombed, or news that many people were displaced.\n\nShe disclosed that since she and her friends launched the campaign, she has been harassed by netizens from both countries. For her, it has been difficult to get through to people how the hyper-nationalistic, violent narratives are spreading hate. Solinn said:\n\nThey have been misinformed and disinformed. They believe these sets of stories, and they have these perspectives, and it's hard to change. So, instead of trying to tell them a different version, we’re trying to appeal to their consciousness. We try to appeal to their empathy.\n\nEven though most of the information they received was not real, it was effective as it was coupled with prejudice, stereotyping, and hate speech amplified by social media. “It has added fuel to the fire of ultra nationalist perspectives. It just made it really hard for people to try to bridge across for people who are like us,” said Solinn.\n\nShe insisted that engaging with the same outrage and accusing each other of doing what each side thinks is wrong will not improve the situation, particularly for disputes that have been going on for hundreds of years, based on selective history from both sides.\n\nSolinn emphasized that it was time to put people’s lives first. Children should be able to return to school instead of living in refugee camps, families should be able to earn their livelihoods again, and both countries need to recognize the damage the conflict has inflicted on their economies.\n\nA call for peace: rebuilding trust and fostering empathy\n\n“We would like to urge the leaders to sit down and find a peaceful resolution and put the people first,” said Phallin. She also urged the leaders to negotiate and rebuild trust, insisting that peace can be achieved only by negotiation, not war.\n\nIn the meantime, Solinn urged the leaders to be compassionate and gentle and to reach a peaceful resolution, adding that a tremendous amount of strength is required. The campaign organizer also called on leaders on both sides to stop this war and allow everything to return to normal for the sake of the innocent people from both countries.\n\nShe suggested that Thailand and Cambodia stop promoting biases and stereotypes based on selective interpretations of history, particularly for the younger generations.\n\nSolinn also believes that when this war ends, Thais and Cambodians will come together to create mixed communities where people from both sides could share safe spaces and raise awareness of peace and harmony.\n\n“Educating in school or through the media wouldn't be enough. We need all the spaces, all the communities, we need a whole society to heal and to promote racial tolerance, peace, solidarity, and harmony,” said Phallin.\n\nIn terms of media, Solinn said media, particularly mainstream media, in both countries should not amplify hateful rhetoric, which has already been dominant on social media, but rather people’s stories, which would help promote reconciliation and peace, suggesting that selective parts of the history on both sides shouldn’t be allowed to frame the whole narrative about Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nShe noted that we did not know everything, but only heard different sides of the story. Each side believed the other started the war first or believed that the other side encroached upon their land.\n\n“Trust is so fragile. It's so easy to break, and it's broken already. It's very hard to rebuild, but we must try. We do not have a choice,” noted Solinn.",

    "title": "The judiciary’s dilemma: Protecting Nigeria’s whistleblowers without legislation",
    "text": "Nigeria’s whistleblower policy, introduced on December 21, 2016, was designed as a quick fix to expose systemic corruption. It promised whistleblowers between 2.5 and 5 percent of recovered looted public funds. However, while the policy incentivizes disclosures, it does not guarantee protection.\n\nInstead, whistleblowers often face surveillance, dismissal, or even death threats. Multiple attempts to pass a whistleblower protection bill over the years have stalled in Nigeria’s National Assembly, leaving whistleblowers legally vulnerable.\n\nNigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework\n\nOn September 18, 2025, Federal High Court judges and civil society advocates debated on Nigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework at a national interactive forum convened by the African Centre for Media & Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) for federal high court judges, in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city.\n\nHarry Ogwuche, the Director of Economic and Social Rights at Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), shared during the debate:\n\nProtecting whistleblowers is not an abstract anti-corruption strategy; it is a direct, proactive investment in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights as enshrined in Chapter IV of our Constitution and various international covenants Nigeria is party to.\n\nThe role of judges in protecting whistleblowers\n\nWhile seeking the support of judges in the advocacy for a whistleblower protection law in Nigeria, Chido Onumah, Coordinator of AFRICMIL, said:\n\nJudges are key actors in any judicial system. Therefore, the forum aims to provide a platform for interaction with judges on whistleblowing, its legal framework, and the critical role they play in ensuring justice for whistleblowers and handling corruption cases effectively.\n\nAt the forum, persecuted whistleblower Yisa Usman shared how he was pressured, intimidated, and sidelined from his profession after blowing the whistle on his company. Usman is a chartered accountant who worked in the finance and accounts department, but after exposing corruption, he was redeployed to the ICT department, transferred to different states, and subsequently fired. He said:\n\nBecause I decided to speak up, I am jobless. I was ostracized and frustrated to accept the norm. To remain silent is to be complicit. To achieve results as a whistleblower, it is important to be familiar with the laws because if you know the laws that guide and protect you, you will be able to challenge them. Despite several attempts to detain me, I am walking free because of the judiciary.\n\nExisting and pending laws to protect whistleblowers\n\nNigeria’s Constitution and several statutes already contain protections that could be extended to whistleblowers. These include: Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. Section 6(4)(c) of the National Human Rights Commission Act prohibits harassment of individuals who cooperate with the Commission. Anti-corruption laws like the EFCC Act and ICPC Act provide limited safeguards. The Freedom of Information Act protects disclosures made in good faith.\n\nIn practice, these fragmented provisions are inconsistently applied, and without a unified protection law, whistleblowers continue to face retaliation.\n\nNigeria’s situation contrasts sharply with that of its regional neighbors. Ghana’s Whistleblower Act (Act 720) and South Africa’s Protected Disclosures Act provide dedicated mechanisms.\n\nVladimir Radomirović, a Serbian journalist and co-founder of Pištaljka, an organization based in Belgrade that provides free legal aid and protection to whistleblowers, shared his experiences of building alliances with the judiciary to strengthen whistleblower protection in Serbia. He said:\n\nThe judges have a very influential role in protecting whistleblowers in Serbia, and we try to work with judges and allow them to hear from whistleblowers about how they are retaliated against for protecting the public interest.\n\nAFRICMIL and its partners urged the Nigerian legislature to urgently enact the whistleblower protection law, one that guarantees anonymity, provides penalties against retaliation, and establishes an independent body to oversee cases.\n\nWhistleblowers and civil society organizations appealed to judges to embrace a proactive role in safeguarding whistleblowers. They called for progressive adjudication that interprets existing laws in the spirit of transparency and protection for defenders; expedited hearings to ensure justice is not delayed and therefore denied; the awarding of exemplary damages against retaliators to serve as a deterrent; and above all, the protection of anonymity in court procedures. These recommendations, they argued, are vital if the judiciary is to strengthen trust, uphold justice, and ensure that whistleblowing truly serves as a tool for accountability in Nigeria.",

    "title": "Nepal’s Khoj Samachar challenges corruption and empowers youth through digital media",
    "text": "There are nearly 4,900 registered print media outlets in Nepal. Around eighteen news outlets operate exclusively online through digital platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. By law, online media must register with Nepal’s Department of Information and Broadcasting; however, not all outlets currently comply with this requirement.\n\nStanding out among these registered outlets is Khoj Samachar, an independent digital media platform that raises awareness among young people, challenges corruption, and amplifies underrepresented voices in Nepal. Its founder, Roshan Shrestha, is an investigative journalist from Nepal. His approach relies on digital platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and a dedicated app to draw public attention to marginalized stories and pressure authorities to take action. The platform publishes content in Nepali, in both text and video formats.\n\nAbdulrosheed Fadipe of Global Voices interviewed Roshan via WhatsApp to discuss his journey as an investigative journalist and how he uses digital platforms to promote social change, strengthen good governance, and encourage citizen engagement in Nepal.\n\nGlobal Voices (GV): What inspired you to start Khoj Samachar, and what challenges did you face in building it from scratch?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): I started my journalism journey during my school years at Shree Bachchhala Devi Higher Secondary School, Nagpuje, Sindhupalchok District, in Bagmati Province of Nepal. When I was in class 8, a man who was the presenter at Avenues Television came to my school to teach students about journalism. That training programme planted the seed of journalism in my mind.\n\nMy interest in journalism grew after a devastating earthquake occurred in Nepal in 2015. Although the epicenter of the earthquake was located in Gorkha district, many houses in my village, which is located near the Bhotekoshi River, were destroyed. Many people lost their lives. The Tataponi border crossing with China was also closed. I had just completed class 11 then. I was using a simple Android phone because I was from a low-middle-class family that depended on agriculture for a living. With that phone, I started filming and uploading videos of the earthquake's destruction of villages on a YouTube channel. This was how my journalism career began.\n\nIn 2021, I officially launched Khoj Samachar. I did not receive any financial support when I started nor did I have a big team. Now we have a team of four individuals broadcasting news in both English and Nepali.\n\nGV: How do you maintain editorial independence and ensure your outlet's content remains unbiased and free from external influences?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): We do not take money, favors, or support from any political party, business group, or outside donor. From day one, Khoj Samachar has survived only through the income we earn from Facebook and YouTube ads. With those limited earnings, we pay our team and run the entire platform. This is not always easy, but it gives us full freedom. Nobody can tell us what to say or what to hide. We can question leaders, expose corruption, and speak for the people without fear of losing sponsors or upsetting funders. Our only loyalty is to our readers and viewers. For us, independence is more valuable than comfort. Even if the road is difficult, we choose truth over compromise — that is why our content remains unbiased and trusted.\n\nGV: How do you prioritize stories that amplify underrepresented media voices, and what impact do you hope these stories have on your audience?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): At Khoj Samachar, we always give priority to the voices that big media often ignores — farmers, workers, rural youth, and ordinary citizens who face injustice. Many times, people from villages directly contact us to share their pain, because they feel unheard elsewhere.\n\nWe have highlighted stories like that of a person struggling to get a bridge built in his village, a road left unfinished for 10 years, or a family trapped in hardship without support. By showing these issues through videos, we try to bring public attention and pressure the authorities to act.\n\nOur hope is that by giving a platform to these underrepresented voices, young people will feel more connected, more aware, and inspired to raise their own voices. We want our audience to see that journalism is not only about leaders and cities, but also about the real struggles of common people — and that truth can bring real change.\n\nGV: What strategies do you use to reach audiences beyond capital cities, and how do you measure the impact of your reporting in these areas?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): From the beginning, our focus was not only on Kathmandu but also on rural and remote areas. We create stories that reflect the real problems of villages — like missing bridges in Humla, neglected roads in Dailekh, or migrant workers’ struggles. Many of these issues are sent to us directly by local people through phone calls, Facebook messages, or our app. By turning their voices into reports and videos, we make sure their problems are heard nationally.\n\nTo measure impact, we look at the response from citizens and authorities. For example, in Saudi Arabia, when stranded workers contacted us, our coverage led to parliamentary debates and direct government action. Similarly, when we cover local problems, we monitor community feedback in comments, shares, and messages, and also check if the government or local representatives respond. For us, the real impact is when ordinary people feel their voices are finally heard and some positive change begins.\n\nGV: What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced as an independent journalist, and how have you overcome them?\n\nRS: There have been many difficult moments in my journey, but the most painful ones came when some people, who are unable to accept the truth, started abusing my family and even threatened physical attacks in public. As a journalist, I can tolerate criticism and risk, but when my family is dragged into controversy for my work, it is truly unbearable.\n\nSpeaking the truth, especially against corruption and powerful figures, always brings political pressure. Many tried to silence us or scare us into stopping, but journalism loses its meaning if we compromise with fear. What keeps me going is the trust and support of the public and the inner courage to always speak the truth. The emotional burden is heavy, but I continue because ordinary people rely on us to be their voice, and that responsibility gives me the strength to move forward.\n\nGV: How do you envision the future of Khoj Samachar, and what steps are you taking to ensure its sustainability and continued impact?\n\nRS: My main goal is to build Khoj Samachar as a platform based only on truth and facts, not dependent on external funding or political power. The message I want to pass to youth is that they can succeed in journalism by standing for the truth, even if they are alone. I am working to add more features to the Roshan Shrestha App so that it will be useful for the public. This step will help us sustain our work, expand our impact, and keep serving society with independent journalism.\n\nGV: Why did you name the Roshan Shrestha App after yourself?\n\nRS: By putting my own name on the app, I wanted to assure users that this platform is genuine, transparent, and trustworthy. It is not for self-promotion but rather a matter of responsibility: if my name is attached, people know they can rely on it.",

But sharp cuts to foreign aid by a number of governments are shrinking the available funds for nonprofits, with digital rights organizations like ours taking a particular hit.\n\nAnd it’s a hard time for news and translation organizations right now, with new technologies being used to cut staff and mass-produced disinformation crowding out quality news. Even in this challenging time, Global Voices’ production and readership have been going up, but since we are committed to never paywalling and not showing ads, that doesn’t translate into covering our running costs unless readers donate.\n\nGlobal Voices is a relatively low-cost organization to run: we have no office, no rent, and few physical supplies. We pay for the servers that host our site and a few other administrative costs, but by far the majority of our expenses are for paying our staff. Many grants don’t want to fund more than a small percentage of personnel costs, because they want to pay directly for activities, but personnel costs are the basis of all our activities. Our staff and our volunteers research stories, write and edit, translate and advocate — and sometimes they also do graphic design or photo choice, social media promotion, and more. That is who we’re trying to support with the funds from this campaign — our community, the people who make the articles and essays, translations, research reports, and podcasts that you find on our site.\n\nIf we had a dollar for every page view of the site, we wouldn't need to do a campaign! And if each of those dollars were a monthly commitment, we’d be able to plan ahead for longer-term activities and be generally less stressed. But we know that not everyone can contribute for lots of different reasons, so instead we can think about it as five dollars from one-fifth of the monthly site visits, or ten dollars from one-tenth, and maybe someone who hasn't read anything this month but believes in what we do kicks in twenty-five bucks, and someone else who loves translations sends another fifteen and… you get the idea.\n\nWe hope that you can be one of those contributors, and if you can’t right now, we hope you still come and spend time on our site, and then tell other people about it. Even more than a news site, Global Voices is a community, and we’d like you to be a part of it.

    "title": "The paradox of women’s rights in Peru",
    "text": "By Grecia Flores Hinostroza\n\nIn Peru, women’s rights exist in a strange paradox: on paper, we have the laws, the representation, and the international commitments that promise equality; in reality, our lives tell a different story. Political progress coexists alongside persistent neglect, with numbers that flatter and figures that fail. This contradiction is not hidden in the shadows — the painful contrast is written plainly in the numbers we so proudly display.\n\nAccording to the SDG Gender Index, Peru scores 72.9 for “Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments,” a figure that suggests progress, visibility, and leadership. And yet, when we shift our gaze to health, the score drastically drops to 35.5, barely half. Women are present in Congress, but absent from the healthcare system that should protect them.\n\nIf political participation alone were enough, our streets would be safer, our hospitals accessible, and our voices heard beyond the voting booth. But in Peru, as in much of Latin America, representation has not broken the chains of inequality — it has simply made them less visible to those who govern.\n\nThe data tells one story. The lives of rural, Indigenous, and poor women tell another — one where access to basic sexual and reproductive health services is a distant reality. Where hospitals, experts, and care are unreachable. As the political scientist Stéphanie Rousseau notes in “The Politics of Reproductive Health in Peru,” “Although health sector reforms have had some positive impact on women’s reproductive health, the many restrictions placed on women’s right to reproductive choices have blocked further progress.”\n\nThe consequences are not abstract. In 2020, Peru’s maternal mortality ratio stood at 69 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the World Health Organization, far above the Latin American average of 45 and nearly five times that of Chile (16) and Uruguay (13). These numbers represent women whose lives could have been saved by timely care, safe births and the fulfilment of rights already recognized by law.\n\nBut these injustices are not only moral failures; they are legal betrayals. Peru has signed its name beneath international promises: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and others. These are not distant treaties gathering dust in diplomatic archives. They are binding commitments, written to safeguard the dignity, health, and safety of women — commitments meant to reach every hospital room, courtroom, and remote village in our country.\n\nLaws protecting sexual and reproductive health rights exist on paper, but they remain distant from the realities of rural, Indigenous, and poor women. Clinics lack essential services. Comprehensive reproductive care is unavailable. Legal frameworks declare equality, but equality disappears in places where women still face forced pregnancies, unsafe births, and systemic neglect.\n\nThe Constitution speaks of equality, but equality does not walk the roads where women carry their pregnancies alone. The Ministry of Health issues protocols, but those protocols do not save lives when the nearest health centre is closed, or when the only doctor is gone. Rights without access are hollow. Commitments without implementation are betrayal.\n\nIn this context, political representation must not be mistaken for liberation. We cannot accept the illusion of progress that comes from more women in office if it is not matched by concrete action to dismantle structural barriers. Empowerment is not an empty slogan — it is the lived reality without fear, accessing healthcare without barriers, and raising one’s voice without retaliation.\n\nThe gap between law and life is not an abstract policy flaw; it is a daily crisis. It is the young girl in a rural province forced to give birth after sexual assault because abortion is inaccessible. It is the mother who dies on the way to a hospital that never has the capacity to treat her. Likewise, it is the Indigenous community where reproductive rights exist only in the language of faraway courts, not in the practice of local healthy systems.\n\nIf we measure success only by the presence of women in power, we ignore the absence of justice in their communities. Numbers in parliament cannot compensate for empty maternity wards. International recognition cannot replace the right to safe childbirth.\n\nI call on the Peruvian Congress to legislate not for appearances, but for autonomy. To ensure that health, safety, and dignity are realities in every province. I call on international donors to fund the fight for reproductive freedom, not just political participation. And I call on Peruvian society to recognize that representation without rights is no victory at all.\n\nRepresentation matters. But it is only the beginning. Real empowerment is when every woman controls her future — her body, her health, her voice — regardless of where she was born or how far she lives from the capital. Until the day, the paradox will remain, and progress will be a promise half-kept.",

    "summary": "By Grecia Flores HinostrozaIn Peru, women’s rights exist in a strange paradox: on paper, we have the laws, the representation, and the international commitments that promise equality; in reality, our lives tell a different story.\nAs the political scientist Stéphanie Rousseau notes in “The Politics of Reproductive Health in Peru,” “Although health sector reforms have had some positive impact on women’s reproductive health, the many restrictions placed on women’s right to reproductive choices have blocked further progress.”The consequences are not abstract.\nPeru has signed its name beneath international promises: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and others.\nLaws protecting sexual and reproductive health rights exist on paper, but they remain distant from the realities of rural, Indigenous, and poor women.\nLikewise, it is the Indigenous community where reproductive rights exist only in the language of faraway courts, not in the practice of local healthy systems.",

    "title": "Pro-government campaign against student protests attempts to justify repression in Serbia",
    "text": "This analysis by Nataša Stanojević was originally published by the International and Security Affairs Centre (ISAC), part of the regional initiative Western Balkans Anti-Disinformation Hub. An edited version is republished by Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nThe protest held on June 28 this year in Belgrade, on the Serbian national and religious holiday, Vidovdan, represented the culmination of months of public discontent with government policies and systemic societal problems.\n\nVidovdan is deeply rooted in national history and collective memory and has often been used as a symbol of political and moral struggle. In this case, students and other citizens chose the date to underscore the seriousness of their demands for responsible governance, to call for snap elections, and advocate for essential institutional reforms.\n\nAccording to estimates, the protest gathered around 140,000 people, making it one of the largest political gatherings in the past decade. The sheer size of the turnout reflects profound social frustration and a sense that institutional mechanisms for expressing discontent have completely failed. However, while the organizers’ demands were clearly defined — fighting corruption, institutional accountability, and democratization of the system — pro-government media constructed an entirely different picture.\n\nInstead of fact-based reporting, the public sphere was flooded with sensationalist headlines and claims aimed at delegitimizing the protests and criminalizing participants. The student movement and citizens were not portrayed as advocates of democratic values, but as a threat to the stability of the state. This strategy of criminalization, typical of authoritarian regimes, allowed the authorities to justify the use of force and intensified repression.\n\nPro-government media in Serbia systematically employ false and manipulative narratives to discredit legitimate civic protests and normalize the state’s repressive responses. Analysis shows that key propaganda tactics include labeling participants, manipulating events, constructing an image of a foreign enemy, and glorifying police force. These practices have long-term consequences for democratic processes and freedom of expression.\n\nInstruments of the propaganda narrative\n\nOne of the most commonly used strategies was the deployment of pejorative labels. Organizers and participants were not referred to as students or citizens but as “blockaders,” “hooligans,” and “terrorists.”\n\nA headline in the tabloid newspaper Informer, “Anti-hooligan operation in the city center: Watch how blockaders are arrested,” illustrates how police intervention was presented as necessary and legitimate, while citizens were criminalized. The term “terrorists” carries particularly strong connotations, suggesting extremism, even though the protests were peaceful in nature.\n\nMedia outlets widely circulated narratives about an alleged “hellish plan” by demonstrators. Headlines such as “Bridges and the entire city under siege: The new hellish plan of blockader terrorists, they want blood and dead bodies on the streets!” create an atmosphere of fear and suggest inevitable escalation into violence. These unfounded claims serve to mobilize the government’s loyal voter base and legitimize repressive measures. Rhetoric about “blood on the streets” and “danger to citizens” not only criminalizes protest participants but also frames them as a national security threat.\n\nPro-government discourse attributed goals to the protesters, such as “destroying the state” and “overthrowing the president.” These claims are not based on any documents or public statements by organizers, whose demands focused on improving safety, fighting corruption, and ensuring political accountability. Introducing accusations of “treason” and “collaboration with enemies” is part of a broader model of political propaganda in which social resistance is portrayed as a conspiracy against national interests.\n\nWhile pro-government media insisted on an image of violent demonstrations, actual events tell a different story. According to reports from independent media and human rights organizations, the majority of the protest was peaceful. This was also confirmed by the Council of Europe.\n\nThe few incidents that occurred happened only after police intervention, during which excessive force was used. The arrests or detentions of hundreds of people, along with documented cases of physical abuse, clearly show that state repression was the dominant dynamic. This gap between the media narrative and empirical facts is a classic example of the framing technique — selective presentation of reality to shape public opinion.\n\nThe broader political context and the foreign enemy narrative\n\nParticularly concerning is the strategy of linking the protests to alleged foreign enemies, in this case, Croatia. Certain tabloids and politicians suggested that the organizers of the protests were instruments in the hands of Croatian intelligence structures and that their goal was the destabilization of Serbia. These claims have no factual basis, but serve a clear propaganda purpose: to evoke historical tensions and use national stereotypes to create a sense of threat among citizens. (The hostilities between Serbia and Croatia have deep roots in their national narratives. These tensions began during the Ottoman Empire when many Serbian refugees were settled in Croatia by the Austrian authorities. The animosity intensified during World War II when Croatia joined the Axis powers, and was solidified during the wars that accompanied Yugoslavia’s breakup. This period culminated in Operation Storm, which resulted in the majority of Serbs fleeing Croatia.)\n\nThe use of Croatia in this narrative has a dual function: first, to mobilize patriotic sentiment; by suggesting that the protests are connected to a “hostile state,” the government reinforces its image as the defender of national interests. Second, it discredits the opposition and civic initiatives; by attributing “foreign influence” to the protests, the government delegitimizes their goals and diverts attention from internal problems such as corruption and institutional breakdown. This rhetoric relies on the well-known model of “constructing a foreign enemy,” which, according to political communication theory, serves to homogenize the electorate and justify authoritarian practices.\n\nA particularly alarming segment of the propaganda campaign concerns the linkage of protests with the issue of Srebrenica. (The 1995 massacre of the Muslim population in Srebrenica and its surrounding areas by the Army of Republika Srpska is frequently exploited by both nationalist and anti-Western factions in Serbia. Similar to narratives that deny the Holocaust, discussions about Srebrenica range from complete denial to unsettling debates about the number of victims, their nationality, and the use of terms like “necessary military action” and “collateral damage.” Over the past 15 years, anyone who does not support these narratives has been labeled a “traitor” or a “Western agent” in official political discourse.)\n\nIn an Informer article entitled “They’ve exposed themselves! This is blockader politics: Accusing Serbia of a nonexistent genocide in Srebrenica,” students were accused of “agreeing with accusations that brand Serbs as a genocidal nation.” This narrative attempts to shift the focus from demands for democratization to a national question, creating the impression that the protests have an “anti-Serbian agenda.” In this way, civic resistance is criminalized through manipulation of one of the most emotionally charged issues in the public sphere.\n\nA similar rhetoric is used by the portal Vaseljenska in the article “Blockaders want to declare Serbs a genocidal nation: Elections, then a government that will recognize the genocide in Srebrenica.” These claims are absent from any official demands of the organizers, but their function is clear: to discredit the protests by linking them with alleged plans to “betray national interests.” Thus, the government constructs a narrative in which students are not only “hooligans” but also agents of dangerous ideological and political projects.\n\nNarrative vs objective facts\n\nIn the long term, such practices lead to the consolidation of authoritarian patterns of governance. When every criticism of regime representatives is labeled as “treason” or “terrorism,” the space for democratic dialogue disappears. This not only delegitimizes protests but also undermines the fundamental values on which modern democratic societies rest.\n\nThis analysis of the media narrative surrounding the Vidovdan protests demonstrates that pro-government media act as a propaganda apparatus whose primary function is the preservation of political power, not informing the public. Through the dissemination of a distorted perception of civic resistance, the construction of violent scenarios, and the invention of foreign enemies, the authorities succeed in delegitimizing valid social demands and justifying repressive measures. Such a strategy may stabilize the regime in the short term, but in the long run, it erodes the foundations of democracy and leads to further political and social crises.",

    "text": "This Dart Centre Asia Pacific Report by Arun Karki was originally published in Nepali Times, and an edited version has been republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.\n\nWhat should a journalist do when young protesters are shot in front of her? Does she do her job and stay neutral? Can you stay neutral?\n\nAs Gen Z protests engulfed Kathmandu, Nepal's journalists found themselves reporting a story that was personal. While doing their job, some of them were even targeted by mobs.\n\nRead More: Gen Z stands up to expose corruption in Nepal\n\nDart Asia Pacific Fellow Arun Karki visited their newsrooms and spoke with his colleagues about their experience of reporting the Gen Z protests that erupted on September 8th. These are the first-hand accounts of journalists who witnessed the turmoil in the city they call home.\n\nSunita Karki was at a workshop in a hotel on September 8th. She saw the first waves of protests through hotel windows. Curfew alerts flooded her phone, a vehicle belonging to a human rights group sat burning across the road, young boys were taking their wounded friends on motorbikes to local hospitals, and police were beating a teenager with their hands raised.\n\n“I cried a lot,” she said, but the tears were not out of fear — they were because she felt guilt. “I couldn’t write the news. We were witnessing these scenes from a five-star hotel.” By evening, the death toll had reached 19. On September 9th at about 3:35 pm, her outlet, the Annapurna Post's office in Tinkune, Kathmandu, was set on fire. Staff had to leave the building as parts of the newsroom burned down.\n\nWhen she knew her office was burning, she anxiously told her husband that she would resign from the job: “If we have to hide our identification cards in every protest, what kind of journalist am I?” she asked herself.\n\nShe filed a story the next day, but her emotions kept bouncing between those of a journalist bound to duty and a civilian in shock. She said that in moments like this, it’s hard to feel truly neutral.\n\nAfter watching the police beat people, she felt a strong urge to step in, not just stand back and report. The first real calm came later, when people came to the street and lit candles together in honor of those who were killed. “This was a sort of victory procession. I felt some relief after brutal days,” she said.\n\nAngad Dhakal a photojournalist who works at Kantipur National Daily, was standing outside his office building when protesters stormed in and set parts of it on fire. He had already been informed that protesters were planning to torch his office building and rushed to his office hoping to save his hard drives containing ten years of photography work. He failed.\n\nHe raised his camera and “forcefully” pressed the shutter — more to document the scene than out of “professional enthusiasm or duty.”\n\n“My office was burning. What should I photograph?” he recalled. A few moments later, a protester noticed the “PHOTO” label on his yellow Press jacket. Dhakal deflected it by saying he was an early-career freelancer and YouTuber. He went into a corner and took his jacket off so that protesters wouldn't target him.\n\nWhen it comes to covering street protests, Angad usually stands near the police because it feels safer. But on September 8th, fire and gunshots made even that area unsafe. A rubber bullet hit his friend Dipendra Dhungana, badly injuring him.\n\nHe thought, “Where do we go now? If we stay here, we’ll be hit.” After witnessing two days of protests, violence, and killings, and seeing his own office burning, he couldn't sleep for days.\n\nThe same afternoon that government buildings burned and media outlet Kantipur was attacked, a message in a protest Discord forum talked openly of “attacking Kantipur.”\n\nRumors spread to other outlets. Outside OnlineKhabar's office, where Gaurav Pokharel works, the newsroom manager said, “Very suspicious people were walking around.” They lowered blinds, avoided windows, locked the front gate, and dispersed staff to other places across the city. The outlet was threatened and effectively locked down, but not torched.\n\nPokharel hid his press ID. “ I never showed the ID card. Sometimes I had to enter the crowd shouting slogans, just to blend in among the protesters,” he said. He watched people fall under gunfire, and he helped pull one surrounded journalist out of a hostile crowd.\n\nGaurav also contributed articles to international outlets as a freelancer. Later, while transcribing an interview of a young protest organizer, he wrote to his editor at an international outlet: “This was very hard to write. I cried many times while doing it.” He had been working at a stretch for days, battling bouts of exhaustion and low blood pressure.\n\nProtesters vandalized and set fire within the Singha Darbar complex housing Nepal Television and Radio Nepal. They tried to disrupt public broadcasting.\n\nSurendra Paudyal began the day with his press ID hanging on his neck, thinking it would let him move freely. But when he reached Singha Darbar around 3:30 pm, the situation felt dangerous.\n\nHe put the ID in his pocket. When asked what mattered most, he answered without pause: life comes first. In that moment, he felt real fear and a strong duty to protect his team.\n\nHis focus narrowed to basic things: stay calm, find exits, get everyone out safely. Later, they were able to keep the 8 pm news on air through a regional link. He felt mixed emotions and a sense of relief that the broadcast continued, but also sadness and anger that their own studio had come under attack.",

    "title": "The great silence surrounding marital rape in Senegal",
    "text": "By Bowel Diop\n\nGender-based violence, including marital rape, occurs worldwide, and often, the perpetrators are the victim's husband. Marital rape is defined as an act in which one partner forces the other to engage in non-consensual sex. A report by Equality, a US-based organisation with offices in New York, Nairobi, and London, reveals that many women are affected by this phenomenon, including many in Africa.\n\nIn private online forums where women post under anonymity, distressing testimonies emerge about the violence they suffer within relationships. Out of respect and for the protection of those sharing their stories, no names or platform details are revealed. Behind these testimonies emerges a chilling reality: that of sexual relations imposed within marriage without the woman’s consent, in other words, the reality of marital rape.\n\nAs violence against women becomes increasingly common, consent is being trampled. The notion of “conjugal duty” still frequently outweighs a woman’s right to make decisions about her body.\n\nIt is in these digital spaces, where distress is voiced and violence normalized, that discussion groups take shape, embodying a form of digital sisterhood. Providing room for listening, support, and open speech, these spaces enable women to challenge together the taboos that restrict their empowerment, online as well as offline. This safe space where women share their experiences underlines the urgency of an open and courageous debate on marital rape in Africa.\n\nA cultural, religious, and legal debate\n\nIn May 2025, the program “Midi Plus” on TFM Télévision Futur Média, based in Senegal, gave national exposure to Oustaz Modou Fall, a Muslim authority in the country. This preacher claims that conjugal duty takes precedence over consent, thereby legitimizing sexual violence in the name of marriage. Speaking in Wolof, he stated:\n\nGnouni loi bi néna sakh sa diabar so beugué teud akk mom té dacoroul daga ko violé . Pfff wakhi dof ! Sa diabar ga takk ko so farata Yallah akk souna Seydouna Mohamed , touki Pape Samba dem tournage soneu baye beugu dé gnibissi beugu teud ak sokhname gnouniko bouné dama soneu damadone fobéré (rires) ga forcéko viol le. Boudé lou amm la , lane moye texte bi. Si diné.\n\nPeople say the law declares that if you force your wife to have sex, that counts as rape. Pfff — absurd, this is your wife, the one you married before God. You travel, you work, Pape Samba [the host], you come back exhausted, you want to be with your wife, and she refuses. She says she’s tired, that she was doing the housework (laughter). So if you insist, it’s rape? If that’s the case, which religious scripture says so? We must be cautious about this.\n\nThe broadcast immediately sparked indignation across social media. On TikTok, activists and legal experts mobilized. The Xam Sa Droit page published a series of videos challenging Modou Fall’s statements against existing legislation. Specifically, it points to Article 320 of Senegal’s Penal Code, which defines rape as any act of penetration “carried out through violence, coercion, threat or surprise.” This is a reminder that marriage does not take away any fundamental rights, and that refusing sex, even within a couple, remains an inalienable right. This effort at legal education was met with strong support on TikTok, as it put consent back at the center of the discussion.\n\nVoices were also raised on X. Nabou Diop Lo, a lawyer and activist for women’s and children’s rights, posted:\n\nLe viol tel que définit dans le code pénal Sénégalais ne fait pas une distinction entre le viol commis dans le ménage et celui commis hors des liens conjugaux. Tout ce qui compte c'est le consentement de la victime. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nRape, as defined in the Senegalese Penal Code, makes no distinction between rape committed within marriage and that committed outside it. What matters is the victim’s consent. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nBut how can a woman dare complain she's been raped when a religious figure claims that a wife’s “no” carries no weight? This dissonance between the law, public discourse, and women’s lived reality highlights the urgent need for legal reform and a clear stance from the authorities.\n\nBy normalizing marital rape, this official rhetoric entrenches an absolute claim over women’s bodies and heavily compounds the moral weight borne by potential victims.\n\nEquality Now’s 2024 report shows that the legal recognition of marital rape differs significantly across Africa. The report notes that countries such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Madagascar, Senegal, and Togo explicitly criminalize marital rape.\n\nIn countries including Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Tanzania, spouses are explicitly exempted from prosecution, except in exceptional cases.\n\nIn Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mali, Uganda, and Chad, the law remains silent on the matter, creating a complete legal void.\n\nSenegalese law on rape and paedophilia, revised in 2020, sets out the definition of rape as follows:\n\nTout acte de pénétration « commis par violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise ».\n\nAny act of penetration ‘committed by violence, coercion, threat, or surprise.’\n\nHowever, the lack of clear legal provisions on marital rape and spousal consent creates a wide scope for interpretation, often to the detriment of the victim. As a result, marital rape is often treated as an ordinary form of domestic violence, rather than classified as a criminal offence.\n\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, for example, an investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde published in February 2024 reported that a humorous TikTok video mocking women’s sexual fatigue sparked amused reactions — evidence that sexual non-consent is not taken seriously.\n\nAccording to figures published in African Health Sciences, 33 percent of women in Africa have been subjected to sexual violence at some point in their lives, with rates rising to 44 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Côte d’Ivoire, 40 percent of women housed in the shelter run by the NGO Akwaba Mousso say they have suffered marital rape.\n\nIn many African legal systems, including in Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, the implicit presumption of consent between spouses prevents marital rape from being effectively recognised as a crime.\n\nWhen feminists raise awareness on the subject, the issue is frequently minimised. In the previously mentioned Le Monde article, Ivorian activist Marie-Paule Okri, co-founder of the Ivorian League for Women’s Rights, told the journalist:\n\nQuand on essaie d’en parler, on nous répond qu’on exagère. On nous inculque depuis l’adolescence que le corps de la femme est fait pour donner du plaisir à l’homme.\n\nWhen we try to talk about it, we are told we are exaggerating. From adolescence, we are taught that a woman’s body exists to give pleasure to men.\n\nYet Article 14 of the Maputo Protocol commits African states to guaranteeing women’s fundamental rights, including health and reproductive consent.\n\nBeyond legislation, it will take a deep change in attitudes to improve women’s condition, grounded in respect for their bodies and equality in relationships.",

    "title": "A region on the brink: The global implications of the war on Gaza · Global Voices",
    "text": "On October 7, 2023, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), the group that governs the Palestinian territory of Gaza, breached the barrier that has surrounded the densely populated area for the last 16 years, preventing the free flow of people and goods. The militants then launched an attack on 22 nearby Israeli settlements, towns, and military bases, killing around 1,200 civilians and soldiers and taking at least 199 hostages.\n\nMany governments around the world have condemned the attack as a war crime and act of terror, while other governments blamed Israel for setting the stage for these attacks to take place. Since then, many governments have described Israel’s response as disproportionate: the official death toll now exceeds 40,000 Palestinians killed, including over 15,000 children — some experts estimate the actual number to be over four times higher.\n\nFor more, read Global Voices’ previous Special Coverage: Israel’s war on Gaza\n\nThe assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas Political Bureau, in Tehran on 31 July 2024, and a key Hezbollah military commander in Beirut on 30 July have significantly escalated tensions in the region. These targeted killings, combined with the failure to implement a ceasefire, are raising the risk of a war that could engulf the whole region, with potentially far-reaching consequences for global peace and stability.\n\nIsrael’s actions, including its military occupation, settlement expansion, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and recurrent operations in Gaza and the West Bank, have drawn widespread accusations of human rights violations and defiance of international law. This includes an International Court of Justice (ICJ) initial ruling on an ongoing case finding it plausible that Israel is committing genocide and an application by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for arrest warrants against three Hamas leaders — including Haniyeh — and two Israeli officials — including Prime Minister Netanyahu — for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe arrest warrants include one for Mohammed Deif, Commander-in-Chief of Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. the Israeli army claims to have assassinated Deif in an airstrike on July 13 in the Al Mawasi humanitarian safe zone in Gaza — one that killed at least 90 people in a massacre described by United Nations official Scott Anderson as “some of the most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.”\n\nIsrael's military operations and targeted assassinations in neighboring countries continue despite United Nations Security Council resolutions, global calls for a ceasefire, and repeated condemnations from international humanitarian organizations who have labeled them as violations of international humanitarian law. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached catastrophic levels, with an illegal blockade that has led to severe shortages of vital supplies and the threat of a poliovirus outbreak, exacerbating the suffering of the population, with nine out of 10 people internally displaced, many of them multiple times.\n\nThe international community’s failure to enforce a ceasefire or hold Israel accountable has highlighted the limitations of global institutions in managing the crises. The United Nations has failed to mediate effectively, with its resolutions ignored, and global and regional players have not put pressure on Israel to accept or implement ceasefire resolutions adopted by the UNSC or proposed by mediators. This raises significant questions about the effectiveness of international law in protecting civilians in conflict zones.\n\nIn this special coverage, we explore the regional and global implications as well as the challenges facing international law in addressing the ongoing crisis.",

    "title": "How one community in Trinidad & Tobago pushed the culinary boundaries of pigeon peas",
    "text": "By Natalie Briggs\n\nWhen I first met Florence Warrick-Joseph, there were two things I didn’t know. One, we were related in that pumpkin vine way only Caribbean people can be. Two, the doubles I had just bought from her at a pop-up market had a surprise in them.\n\nIt wasn’t the comforting warmth of a bara hot out of the box, leaking through greaseproof paper. It wasn’t the silken tear of teeth into that just-fried pillowy goodness, which, if you’re lucky, will still hold a hint of the crackle of oil.\n\nNo, it wasn’t that.\n\nIt was the filling. Cucumber, check. Sweet sauce, check. The heady bouquet of garlic, cumin and spices was there. But there was something different in the mouth feel. It wasn’t the melt-in-your-mouth consistency of the channa that makes doubles a national byword in Trinidad and Tobago. Tasty, yes … but different.\n\nThe same bouquet is heavy in Warrick-Joseph’s small kitchen, tickling the nostrils, making me think about the last time I ate. “I don’t curry the peas. I stew it,” she revealed, while demonstrating how she puts her spin on the popular street food. This is not her only departure from the norm. The peas she uses? They are pigeon peas.\n\nThese days, it isn’t quite the record scratch moment it was when it first appeared — but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. What we should be discussing is how pigeon peas, the stuff of pelau and coconut milk stew-downs, ended up in doubles. It started as an exhortation to think outside the box.\n\nIn 2014, Warrick-Joseph, a retired registered nurse, decided to do an event management course. Her lecturer asked the cohort to stretch themselves beyond the ho-hummery of birthday parties and christenings for their practicum. She was an avid planter of pigeon peas, one of the many members of the Upper Cemetery Street Residents’ Association in Diego Martin, to do so. They had a bumper crop that year.\n\n“We were walking back down the hill,” Warrick-Joseph recalled. “Me, Errol [her husband] and Mr. Timothy. And he asked what were we going to do with all these peas. My husband said, ‘We will freeze it, we will sell it.’ Because that is what people do to get money to put in the organisation. So I said, thinking out of the box, we could have a pigeon peas festival.”\n\nThe two men were sceptical. Warrick-Joseph continued, “They were like, ‘Nobody ever heard of a pigeon peas festival.’ I said, ‘I’ve heard of a mango festival. I’ve heard of a breadfruit festival. There’s a chocolate festival. Why not pigeon peas?’”\n\nThe stage was set, but the main players were yet to arrive. They had the peas, but it would literally take a village to showcase their versatility. By the time the first festival rolled around in 2015, it was a result of a true community effort. They were able to generate so many recipes, including a version of doubles, that there were enough to fill a commemorative book.\n\n“We got someone to do pholourie,” Warrick-Joseph said. “We got somebody who could do pigeon peas accra. Everybody ended up taking a recipe. We found people in the community who could do these things. The pigeon peas roti was from a woman who did roti, and instead of using the dhal with the split peas, she used the pigeon peas.”\n\nPholourie? Accra? Roti? It wasn’t such a stretch of the imagination. After all, pigeon peas’ nutty, earthy flavour lends itself well to a variety of savoury preparations. That’s why it’s a perennial favourite across the Caribbean.\n\nBut Warrick-Joseph was about to hit me another curveball. That first festival, she came up with four of her own recipes. One for ice cream. One for a punch. One for a pigeon peas wine. Then one for a liqueur. Two of those are sweet. One of them officially qualifies as dessert. The trick was in picking, shelling and stewing the fresh pigeon peas to form the custard base all within 24 hours, while they were still full of flavour. My mind had more difficulty wrapping around the idea of pigeon peas as this creamy, cold concoction.\n\nThere were no such problems with the muffins. As I stood and watched her prepare them, different scents filled the kitchen, this time with her signature spice blend. It was the spice, I realised, that gave it the illusion of being sweet. I hadn’t seen her put a lot of sugar into the mixture. The eventual result was dense, reminding me more of a coconut drop than the traditional muffin with its cakey crumb. Fresh out of the oven, breaking into one was a treat; I could smell the spices wafting up from the steamy centre. There was nutmeg. Some cinnamon, too.\n\nNothing in the flavour screamed pigeon peas. That was more in the texture and the solidity with which it sat in my stomach. One muffin felt like a full meal, which led me to ask about the nutritional benefits of the pigeon peas substitution. I found out that, among other things, they were high in potassium and fibre, and were good for gut flora, diabetics, and women who wanted to lose weight.\n\nIn fact, it was trying to cater to customers who wanted healthier alternatives to doubles that prompted Warrick-Joseph to come up with a recipe for gluten-free bara, made with pigeon pea flour: “The reason for the switch was that people felt they wanted gluten-free. There was a group of people that was intolerant to normal flour.”\n\nThese were what I had really come to see her prepare, the muffins being a delectable side journey. I knew it would be different from the first doubles I had from her, since the bara in that one had been made the regular way, with flour, leavening agent and oil. How different this version would be, both in taste and feel, was left to be seen.\n\nIt was a three-flour mix, including the ground pigeon peas, which resulted in a tacky, sticky sort of dough that was allowed to rest for about half an hour. While it did that, Warrick-Joseph warmed the oil in which she would fry them later, and prepared the pigeon peas filling. We talked about many things while she did this, including her business and her plans to eventually have pre-packaged products in the supermarket.\n\nWhen she deemed the dough ready, she put the peas aside. The low gluten content made it difficult to handle as it tears easily, which is why she prefers to use a pastelle press to shape them, instead of rolling them out the traditional way. From there, the perfect circles went into the warmed oil, where they puff up slightly — nothing like the regular bara, because of the low gluten content. By the time they are done, I’m itching to try them.\n\nWarrick-Joseph presented them to me on a plate, complete with pigeon peas filling, cucumber and a tangy tamarind sweet sauce. I took a bite, and chewed slowly, trying to make up my mind about them. The verdict? All the elements were there. This tasted like doubles. Purists might draw the line at the bara, which was more reminiscent of a soft taco shell — flatter, with a slight, mealy crunch to it — while health enthusiasts might hail it as the thing to make doubles great again.",

    "title": "Meet Esther, an independent journalist reporting from the frontlines of Myanmar",
    "text": "Exile Hub is one of Global Voices’ partners in Southeast Asia, emerging in response to the 2021 coup in Myanmar, focusing on empowering journalists and human rights defenders. This edited article is republished under a content partnership agreement.\n\nMost people spend their lives running away from danger. Esther ran toward it.\n\nAfter finding refuge in Australia under UNHCR protection, she made the bold decision to return to the Thailand–Myanmar border in 2023 to continue her journalism. Now, in 2025, she reports from one of Myanmar’s most dangerous conflict zones often under fire, often uncertain of tomorrow. Yet she remains unshaken.\n\nIn a world where silence is safe, Esther chooses the frontline. Her weapon is truth, and she wields it for those who cannot.\n\nA journey against the current\n\nBorn in Mon State in 1993, Esther has always been someone who could not ignore injustice.\n\n“I have never been able to lie to myself or live in misery. If something doesn’t sit right with me, I have to face it head-on,” she reflects.\n\nLike many young people in Myanmar, Esther initially wandered through different jobs, unsure of her calling. She translated movies, worked as a travel and tour sales representative, and later became a public relations officer at a Korean company. But none of these roles felt right.\n\n“I couldn’t stay where I felt trapped or compromised,” she shares.\n\nHer turning point came in 2018 when she attended a basic journalism course. “That’s when I realized writing and sharing opinions was what I had always loved. It felt like home.” After the course ended, she landed her first journalism job at an ethnic media house.\n\nWhen the coup changed everything\n\nBy 2021, Esther was working with a major media house. When the coup hit, her newsroom relocated to Karenni State, and Esther went with them, continuing to report under dangerous conditions. But even after escaping to Australia for safety, the pull of truth was stronger than comfort. In 2023, she made the decision to return.\n\nA few months after she arrived in Thailand, the military made a desperate announcement. In February 2024, the military reactivated its conscription law, mandating that men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 serve in the army. Evading service or helping someone evade could lead to five years in prison.\n\n“As the number of these conscription stories grew, so did my determination to report them,” Esther recalls. But working as an exiled independent journalist came with its own struggles. With no regular income and the constant need for resources, continuing her work was a challenge. That’s when she applied for Exile Hub’s Critical Voices Fellowship 2024 and received it.\n\nBearing witness on the frontlines\n\nEsther began collecting stories from those most affected. She spoke with young men who had fled their villages, fearful of being conscripted. She also interviewed women who had watched brothers and husbands taken by the army, leaving families uncertain and anxious about their loved ones’ fate.\n\nIn September 2024, she published “I Don’t Want Others to Face What I Faced: Stories of Forced Military Conscription,” giving a voice to those the regime wanted silenced.\n\nLater, she followed with another hard-hitting piece, “Snatched from Their Beds, Taken on the Streets — The Young Men in Myanmar Forced to Fight the Junta’s Losing War.”\n\nToday, Esther works deep inside one of Myanmar’s most volatile conflict zones, a place where the sound of gunfire and the threat of airstrikes are constant. Despite the risks, she is satisfied with witnessing the truth with her eyes and documenting and reporting on it.\n\nEsther is more than a journalist. She is a lifeline for those whose cries would otherwise vanish in the dark. And no matter the risk, she will keep writing and keep reporting, because for her, silence is never an option.",

    "text": "Environmental groups initiated global activities and protests from September 18 to 21 to drumbeat the call for urgent climate action amid the worsening pollution and continuing deterioration of the natural ecosystem. The series of protests were held right before the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and less than six weeks away from the UN Climate Summit (COP30) in Brazil.\n\nIn Asia, the “Draw the Line” campaign highlighted the demand to phase out fossil fuels, build renewables, shift to sustainable food, and prioritize the people’s basic needs over corporate interests.\n\nSeveral countries participated in the campaign led by a network of environmental groups and community-based organizations.\n\nIn the Philippines, the campaign was actively supported by local groups resisting projects and policies that threaten the lives and livelihoods of rural and coastal communities. A fluvial protest was organized in the town of Culasi in Antique province, located in the Visayas islands of the Philippines, to call attention to the demand of the small fisherfolk against the entry of commercial fishing operations in municipal waters. Javie Barcinal of 350.org Asia echoed the stand of small fishers.\n\nSmall fishers are among the worst affected by the climate crisis, with warming seas resulting in dwindling catches each year. To make matters worse, the government has allowed industrial fishing to encroach into municipal waters. This exacerbates climate injustice that small fishers experience as hunger for their families.\n\nIn Indonesia, environmnetalists organized at least 36 actions in 34 cities and provinces across the country on September 18, to push for bold reforms in government policies. A march was held towards the State Palace on September 19 as rallyists reiterated the anti-corruption demands of the youth-led protests that erupted in the country last month. Sisilia Nurmala Dewi of 350.org Indonesia led climate advocates in asserting an end to corruption to fund a better future.\n\nWe draw the line as flash floods drown the innocent, while people’s voices against government failures are being silenced. Oligarchs and polluters have ruled this country for far too long, taking public money for climate action and destroying natural resources that should be preserved for future generations. We demand real, decisive action. President Prabowo must honor his promises by committing to 100 percent renewable energy in 10 years and a clear immediate plan to phase-out coal plants.\n\nPaskah Toga of Climate Rangers Bali cited the recent flooding disaster in Bali island to rally public opposition against fossil-based power plants.\n\nThe recent deadly floods in Bali is clear evidence that the climate crisis is no longer a distant threat but a reality that needs to be resolved with concrete policies. The government must stop building fossil-based power plants and phase out fossil fuels.\n\nIn Japan, protesters challenged the new leadership to phase out fossil fuels and to reverse policies that blame immigrants for the country’s social woes. Masayoshi Iyoda, 350.org Japan campaigner, summed up their demand.\n\nWe draw the line on Japan’s rising contributions to climate chaos and war. As we experience both flash floods and extreme heat, workers suffer and food prices continue to soar. Japan’s new leadership must show political will to phase out fossil fuels and shift to 100% renewables, instead of going with the far-right tide of blaming immigrants for our economic woes and backsliding on climate action.\n\nThe protest was also attended by activists who expressed solidarity with Palestinians by condemning the continuous bombings and military attacks in Gaza.\n\nIn South Korea, Jiyun Gim of the Green Environment Youth Korea urged authorities to comply with the planned emissions reduction this year.\n\nSouth Korea’s 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) will be determined in November. We are drawing the line to prevent South Korea from setting a climate goal that falls below 60% emissions reduction. This is not just about numbers—it is the survival line for future generations. The government must set ambitious, science-based, and future-oriented climate targets.\n\nIn Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh, community residents staged an action denouncing the planned revival of a coal plant. Shahrukh Karim, a youth leader in Matarbari, articulated the sentiments of the local community.\n\nWe are burning, our lands are dying, and our rivers are drying up. We draw the line on building another coal plant, when the existing one has already driven away thousands of families and turned our homes into a wasteland. This needs to stop.\n\nCommunities Draw the Line on Matarbari Coal Plant 2 Revival https://t.co/2IT1VPkF5P pic.twitter.com/9E05xBK9xV — Energy & Power (@enpbd) September 20, 2025\n\nIn an email interview with Global Voices, 350.org Asia Communications Manager Ilang-Ilang Quijano shared their initial plans on how to sustain the campaign.",

    "title": "Africa charts bold path towards green inclusive development at the second Africa Climate Summit",
    "text": "Over 6,000 delegates gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, for the second Africa Climate Summit (ACS2), held from September 8 to 10, to search for Africa-driven solutions ahead of negotiations for the United Nations 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the world's largest annual environmental conference.\n\nThe second Africa Climate Summit was organized to unite African leaders, youth, and partners in pushing for fair climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s role as a solutions hub, while preparing a common position ahead of COP30 negotiations. It was a pivotal moment for Africa to stake its claim as a leader in the global climate conversation. Leaders, activists, and young innovators came together to push for reforms in climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s youth voices. The gathering was themed around “Accelerating Global Climate Solutions: Financing for Africa’s Resilient and Green Development.” Ethiopia’s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, opened the event with a keynote that set the tone:\n\nAfrica should not be seen only as a victim of climate challenges, but as a continent of solutions and innovations that could guide the world forward.\n\nHe also proposed the “Africa Climate Innovation Compact” to produce 1,000 innovators by 2030, financed and owned by Africans.\n\nThis vision was built on the momentum of the inaugural summit in Nairobi in 2023, which, importantly, was preceded by the African Youth Climate Assembly (AYCA). By doing so, organizers ensured that the majority-youth population of Africa was not just represented but central to shaping the conversation.\n\nThe challenges Africa faces\n\nAfrica continues to wrestle with the painful legacy of historical injustice and the harsh reality of a deepening climate crisis. Despite contributing the least to global emissions, the continent feels the impacts most acutely. Climate finance remains painfully inadequate as wealthy nations have consistently fallen short of their yearly pledge, and African countries today pay back about five times more in debt servicing than they receive in climate aid.\n\nThe cost of this imbalance is causing hospitals to stretch beyond capacity as diseases like malaria and cholera spread more widely under shifting climatic conditions. Crops are failing under the weight of prolonged droughts or sudden floods, leaving farmers with empty fields and families without food. Coastal cities, from Lagos to Dar es Salaam, face rising waters that sweep away homes, businesses, and livelihoods.\n\nYet at the same time, Africa holds some of the richest renewable resources on the planet. If harnessed, its solar capacity alone could power the world many times over. Africa holds 17 percent of the world’s population but receives just 3 percent of global climate investment. Restrictive financial systems and predatory loan arrangements often force African countries back into reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nEcoVista, a youth-led ecological justice movement whose main focus is on climate justice and the environment, based in Nairobi, Kenya posted on its X account:\n\nFossil fuels are the biggest driver of the climate crisis, responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. #MakeThemPay\n\nDraw The Line pic.twitter.com/N9aUDWl8e8 — EcoVistaKe (@EcoVistaKE) September 19, 2025\n\nLayered on top of that is a painful reminder of colonial history. While Africa’s minerals powered industrial growth in the Global North, the continent was left behind with ecological damage and struggling economies. Yearly natural disasters including cyclones, floods, and expanding deserts displace millions every year, and pushed African leaders at ACS2 to adopt the Addis Ababa Declaration, a clear and urgent call for change.\n\nWith regard to the consequences facing Africa, Tangwa Abilu, a Cameroonian Climate and Environmental Activist, shared on X :\n\nThe horn of Africa is grieving because their\n\n-Their farms are no longer yielding\n\n-Advancement of desert is alarming\n\n-Our major rivers are drying\n\n-Proliferation of pest and pathogens\n\n-Development of tropical diseases.\n\n-Our crop are dieing out.\n\nClimate change is a reality. pic.twitter.com/2MQ5fZG1Zo — Tangwa Abilu.🌿🌏🌾🍀🍃.SDG's. (@AbiluTangwa) December 29, 2024\n\nIn the same context, K. Diallo, an African author, drew attention to the damage caused by floods in December 2023. He posted on his X account:\n\nflood disaster in the DR Congo is a result of global warming meeting a failed state…..The global South bears more than 95% of the costs and deaths related to climate change despite making up less than 5% of consumption-based cumulative emissions above 350ppm CO2. pic.twitter.com/vTDobNNVl5 — K.Diallo ☭ (@nyeusi_waasi) December 31, 2023\n\nDemands ahead of COP30\n\nFor African leaders, climate finance must shift from symbolic promises to meaningful reparations. They argue that financing should come as debt-free grants rather than loans that deepen dependency. Historic polluters owe this to frontline communities losing their farms to drought or their homes to rising seas. The Loss and Damage Fund, in particular, needs to prioritize these vulnerable communities with direct, rapid assistance: cash for families in sinking villages, support for starved farmlands, and investment in healthcare for climate-induced trauma. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said:\n\nToo often, Africa's story begins with what we lack: finance, technology, time. Let us instead begin with what we have: the youngest population in the world, vast solar resources, and the resilience to build a new climate economy.\n\nLeaders are also demanding stronger commitments from rich nations. During last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries from the global north pledged to pay USD300 billion in climate finance, but the amount falls far short of the USD1.3 trillion per year needed by African nations, who need it to effectively adapt and transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nACS2 came at a crucial moment when the Lake Chad Basin, which once supported millions across Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic, had shrunk by over 90 percent. With it, the livelihoods of countless families have evaporated. Africa is both the most vulnerable to climate collapse and one of the most promising centers for climate solutions. As the world heads towards COP30 in Brazil in November, Africans say they do not just want to be heard, but are demanding to be recognized as solution builders and shapers of the planet’s shared future.",

    "title": "The legacy of ‘sponge cities’ left by Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian",
    "text": "Yu Kongjian (俞孔坚), 62, the Chinese landscape architect who pioneered the concept of “sponge cities,” died in a plane crash in the Pantanal region, the largest tropical wetland in the world, in Brazil, on September 23, 2025. Three other people also died during the accident: pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, and filmmakers Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., who were both working with Yu to create a documentary about sponge cities. The cause of the crash is under investigation.\n\nFerraz’s work focused on nonfiction productions, including a series about the 2016 plane crash involving the Brazilian football team, Chapecoense. Crispim Jr. worked on projects such as a documentary about Brazilian architect Vilanova Artigas and another about the first women’s football national team in Brazil.\n\nBrazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, posted condolences on his X account and highlighted Yu's work:\n\nFoi com tristeza e consternação que recebi a notícia do desastre aéreo ocorrido no Pantanal no início da noite desta terça-feira, 23. A tragédia, infelizmente, custou as vidas do piloto Marcelo Pereira de Barros, dos documentaristas Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz e Rubens… — Lula (@LulaOficial) September 24, 2025\n\nIt was with sadness and consternation that I received the news about the aircraft disaster that happened in the Pantanal regional, early Tuesday night, the 23rd. The tragedy, unfortunately, took the lives of the pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, documentarians Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., and the Chinese architect Kongjian Yu. In times of climate change, Kongjian Yu became a world reference for sponge cities, which unite life quality and environment protection: something we want — and need — for the future. To all the victims’ friends, family and coworkers, I leave my deepest sorrows.\n\nYu’s legacy\n\nYu was in Brazil to work on a documentary, but he had also recently attended the São Paulo International Architecture Biennale, which was themed “EXTREMES — Architectures for an overheated planet.” Raquel Schenkman, the Institute of Brazilian Architects’ president, responsible for the Biennale’s organization, told G1 Yu was “someone on the frontline of transformations in big urban centers facing climate change.”\n\nOn its website, the Biennale published a note saying that, as the “creator of the theory of sponge cities, Yu Kongjian left a monumental legacy, also urgent to face climate crisis in cities,” and that his work, based on ecosystemic principles, “showed in a practical and poetic way how the landscape can be a vital infrastructure to urban resilience, integrating man to nature in a sustainable way.”\n\nSponge cities concept\n\nYu’s main legacy is designing and implementing projects based on his sponge cities theory. A professor at Peking University, his “sponge city” concept became a top national priority in China in 2013, following the massive floods in the Beijing region in 2012, which left 79 people dead and tens of thousands displaced. He also founded Turenscape, one of the main landscape architecture firms in the world, based in China.\n\nYu cautioned against overly “grey” cities that rely too much on concrete and asphalt, which disrupt natural water pathways and prevent the ground from absorbing water. While conventional water management focuses on draining water through engineered drainage infrastructure, such as pipes and water channels, sponge cities rely on techniques such as green roofs, rainwater storage and infiltration systems, sunken green spaces, permeable pavement, bioretention ponds, wetland revitalization, restoring natural waterflow pathways, and more.\n\n“Floods are not enemies,” Yu explained in an interview with WeForum. “We can make friends with floods. We can make friends with water.”\n\nYu’s approach to urban planning has been successfully implemented in dozens of cities in China, particularly after Chinese President Xi Jinping established his thoughts on ecological civilization in 2018.\n\nIn the past decade, his natural landscape approach is becoming an important tool in city planning and water management around the world.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, where recurring extreme weather events routinely cause massive floods that displace hundreds of thousands, many city planners are looking to sponge cities as a potential solution for unprecedented levels of rainfall.\n\nSo far, the concept has mostly been implemented on a small scale in individual neighborhoods, streets, or areas, meaning its flood mitigation impacts are often limited to the local level, rather than city- or nationwide.\n\nOn X, Zhongshan city's tourism promotion outlet, commemorates Yu's death by highlighting one of his landscape projects in the southern Chinese city:\n\nOn September 23 (Brazilian time), Professor Yu Kongjian from the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at #Peking University, tragically passed away in a plane crash at the age of 62. Professor Yu had won numerous world-class #design awards, including the Oberlander Prize and the John Cobb Common Good Award. Among his representative works is the #QijiangPark in #Zhongshan, #Guangdong . This #park, transformed from the site of a former shipyard, opened in 2001 and quickly gained global attention, winning several domestic and international design awards. In designing and building the park, Professor Yu and his team preserved the original industrial relics, such as shipyard machinery, docks, and other structures, and repurposed them with new functions. [original English version from @Amzhongshan]\n\nYu himself acknowledged that scaling up the pilot projects in Chinese cities was challenging. One of his sponge city projects in Zhengzhou faced backlash after a severe flood in 2021, which claimed 12 lives in the city, prompting many to express doubts about the practicality of his idea. Moreover, as China's coastal regions are highly industrialized, they demand cross-departmental collaboration, strong political will, and extensive administrative coordination to restore concrete riverbanks and seawalls to wetlands.\n\nIn an interview with Brazilian news outlet G1, Yu said that on a scale of 1 to 10, his optimism regarding the world’s chances of reversing climate change ranked 4. He also mentioned water scarcity — one of the challenges his projects aimed to address — as the primary issue humanity will face over the next 25 years.\n\nA journalist living in China, Isabela Shi, shared Yu Kongjian’s last update on a Chinese social media platform:\n\n🕯️No último vídeo que o arquiteto chinês Yu Kongjian divulgou na rede social chinesa, ele estava mostrando a viagem a Pantanal com equipa brasileira que tenta refletir sobre Planeta Esponja através de encolhimento de zonas húmidas. “Wonderful, amazing”, encantou ele pro Brasil. pic.twitter.com/fKn5ZKgIwe — Isabela Shi🇨🇳🇧🇷 (@ShiIsabela) September 25, 2025",

    "title": "How a comics school taught perseverance and creative freedom in Bosnia & Herzegovina",
    "text": "This article by Adin Kadrić first appeared in Balkan Diskurs on September 12, 2025. An edited version is being republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement with the Post-Conflict Research Center (PCRC).\n\nEditor's note: Zenica is a city in the middle of Bosnia and Herzegovina with about 100,000 residents. It is noted for its ironworks industry as well as being home to one of the big prisons in ex-Yugoslavia, described in the cult rock song Zenica Blues. It is not often considered when speaking about art, making the significance of this initiative — which began during the war of 1992-1995 and still persists to this day — even more extraordinary.\n\nFor over 30 years, the Zenica School of Comics has been not only an illustration school but a symbol of perseverance, cultural resistance, and lasting dedication to art. Initially conceived as an escape from the repression of the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and later, a platform for expression and creativity, the school has trained around 200 young artists. About 70 of them have gone on to become prominent young authors, whose works have left a mark on the domestic and regional comics scene.\n\nSeveral graduates are even acclaimed beyond the borders of their country, with Kenan Halilović, Biljana Šafaražik, and Zdravko Cvjetković being some of the most prominent. While the school has been synonymous with quality and creativity within the domestic comic scene for years, the international acclaim for these artists’ work underscores the fact that Zenica maintains a firm foothold in this visual medium.\n\nRecalling its beginnings, Adnadin Jašarević, the school’s founder and director of the Zenica City Museum, said that its primary goal was to give children a creative escape from the harsh realities of war. Under such conditions, comics were like Alice in Wonderland — providing an escape from hunger, fear, and shelling. An average of ten students still pass through the school every year, learning how to translate their thoughts, fears, and hopes into dynamic sequences of frames and speech clouds.\n\nNewer names like Filip Andronik, Milorad Vicanović, Senad Mavrić, and Enis Čišić represent the contemporary wave of comic artists from BiH. They actively cooperate with renowned publishers from the United States and Europe, demonstrating that despite its underdeveloped infrastructure, Bosnia and Herzegovina has comic creators who can stand equally alongside the best talent the genre has to offer.\n\nPublications such as “Horostop,” “ZE strip,” “EKO strip” and “SUV – Steps in Time” were created at the Zenica School, showcasing both its longevity and its dedication to comic culture. Explaining that the students themselves choose the topics they work on according to their own interests, Jašarević noted that he has “never stopped working” to ensure that comics remain a tool for expression and creative release.\n\nAs far as technology’s impact on the comic industry goes, Jašarević explained that while comics used to be widely available to the masses, they are now becoming a far more exclusive product, with expensive integral editions and albums intended for a small but loyal audience. While the idea behind ​​comics as a liberating medium remains the same, the development of technology has heralded a turn in modern-day comic production.\n\nCartoonist and former Zenica student Zdravko Cvjetković, in speaking about the impact of technology, emphasized that smart tablets have made drawing easier and faster for many artists, without compromising the quality of their work. However, he warned that AI tools — such as those used for generating text and images — pose serious ethical and aesthetic questions.\n\nHe believes that the mass availability of tools that produce images and stories in seconds, threatens to trivialize art and blur the line between creativity and automation: “If we all become artists just because we have a tool in our pocket, then nobody is really an artist.”\n\nMany things about comics today, according to Cvjetković, are drastically different than before the war: “Comics are no longer accessible to such a wide audience, especially children. They’re too expensive and rarely found in newsstands.”\n\nThe burgeoning Bosnian comics scene\n\nPointing out that children today reach for screens before print media like comics or books, Cvjetković said that publishers are therefore targeting older generations who grew up with comics.\n\nA positive outcome of this is the growing number of comics festivals in the region, which promote a culture of reading and drawing. “Workshops and comics contests for children [are] an almost mandatory part of every serious festival,” Cvjetković emphasized, “and this is crucial in the absence of comics schools like the one in Zenica.”\n\nComics culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina persists despite its modest ecosystem, in which there is almost no institutional support, and few major publishers or specialized festivals. However, thanks to the enthusiasm of individuals, the scene is not disappearing; in fact, it is quietly but steadily growing.\n\nAuthors like Berin Tuzlić and Enis Čišić have been representing BiH on the regional and international comics scene for years. Tuzlić, known for his experimental approach and multimedia projects, combines comics with music and animation. Čišić, who also tried his hand at Marvel productions, represents a more contemporary, technically precise form of expression. Their work shows that the country is producing talent capable of competing globally.\n\nIsmet Erdić also holds a special place on the BiH comics scene, with his rare combination of historical storytelling and visual narration in comics about Kulin Ban and medieval Bosnia. His work has educational value and is often used in classrooms, which makes him one of the few authors whose comics reach the general public.\n\nDespite unfavorable conditions for comic distribution, publicity, and marketing, comics culture in BiH is still preserved as a niche interest by enthusiasts. Social networks, web comics, and regional cooperation with authors from Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia are currently key to their survival. So, while relatively small, the BiH comics scene has an authentic flair and great potential, waiting for better times ahead.",

    "title": "Civil society initiative fights for equal education opportunities in Togo",
    "text": "In Togo, a national initiative built on civic solidarity helps relieve parents’ yearly back-to-school expenses.\n\nEducation is free and compulsory throughout the country, with a population of over 9.5 million. Following a two-month break (from mid-July to mid-September), more than 3 million students returned to school this month. While the authorities continue to work on improving education through teacher training and recruitment, investing in renovations and school infrastructure, the parents’ main priority is seeing their children succeed at the end of each school year.\n\nOver the years, there has been a marked increase in the gross enrollment rate and the proportion of Togolese students completing the school year. In April 2025, the local news website Lechiquier published:\n\n…le taut brut de scolarisation au primaire dépasse 100%. Il était de l’ordre de 111,70% en 2023, 116,70% en 2024 et une prévision de 116,20% pour l’année 2025. Dans le même sillage, le taux d’achèvement du primaire a évolué de 88,80% en 2023 à 94,60% en 2024. Pour l’année 2025, le gouvernement table sur une augmentation de 121,70%.\n\nThe gross primary school enrolment rate now exceeds 100 percent. In 2023, it was approximately 111.70 percent, in 2024 it was 116.70 percent, and 116.20 percent is forecast for 2025. Similarly, the primary school completion rate increased from 88.80 percent in 2023 to 94.60 percent in 2024. For 2025, the government forecasts an increase to 121.70 percent.\n\nThis rate of over 100 percent is due to it far exceeding the initial estimated value.\n\nFree school education\n\nTogo is one of five African countries with high enrollment rates in school, an impressive development stemming from the various reforms the authorities have implemented in the education sector. In 2008, Togo introduced free pre-school and primary education in the public sector. Since the beginning of the 2021–2022 school year, education in public secondary schools has also been free, a measure the authorities will maintain for the 2025–2026 school year.\n\nThese measures help combat inequities in accessing education. However, efforts, such as providing student school kits (notebooks, books, pens, pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, and school bags), are still required to tackle inequality and ensure universal coverage.\n\nTogo’s guaranteed monthly minimum wage (SMIG) increased from FCFA 35,000 (USD 64) in 2012 to FCFA 52,500 (USD 95) in early 2023. Although this measure was introduced to support the Togolese working population of over 4 million, not all are content with its implementation, condemning the country’s ongoing poor economic situation and challenging living conditions.\n\nAssociation contributions\n\nGiven the financial crisis, parents’ biggest concern is purchasing back-to-school supplies and kits. However, Togolese civil society provides solutions. Citizens, both young and old, are quick to lend their support to help parents meet these expenses.\n\nNumerous citizens, working as part of various associations, travel to the country’s villages and remote areas, assisting and supporting children, especially the most vulnerable. These efforts are a social and solidarity-based alternative to the associations committed to child protection, education, and development.\n\nOne example is Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (the Togolese Child Protection Association or LTPE). On August 29, 2025, LTPE supported 5,000 children from 12 villages of the Amou Prefecture in the Plateaux region.\n\nLe 29 août 2025, plus de 5 000 enfants de la préfecture d’Amou venus de 12 localités différentes ont reçu des kits scolaires grâce à l’initiative « Éducation pour tous : 1 élève, 1 kit, 1 choix de vie » portée par la #LTPE. pic.twitter.com/LMroVuE9oY — Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (@LTPE_ONG) August 30, 2025\n\nOn August 29, 2025, more than 5,000 children from 12 different locations in the Amou Prefecture received school kits through the #LTPE initiative ‘Education for All: One student, one kit, one life choice.’\n\nIn an interview with Togolese media outlet Plume d'Afrique, Nina Afi Kazoulé, the LTPE coordinator, explained the scope of this measure:\n\nNous voulons par cette action éviter le décrochage scolaire. Et nous savons que le décrochage scolaire peut être dû à l'incapacité financière des parents, aux grossesses en milieu scolaire, bref à tous les comportements qui ne sont pas appropriés à adopter par un apprenant.\n\nWe want to prevent school dropouts with this measure. We know that school dropouts can happen due to the parents’ lack of financial resources, pregnancies among school girls, or any inappropriate student behavior\n\nIn the village of Zooti N'titikope, Vogan, a town 45 kilometers northwest of the Togolese capital Lomé, the Togovi Bé Sourire association and Action for Peace and Good Governance (APGG) joined forces with several other associations on September 5 and 6 to support young learners. More than 300 vulnerable children received school kits, and 20 young girls will be monitored and supported in successfully reintegrating into school.\n\nLomé also has vulnerable children supported by other groups, including the Premiers Pas pour l’Enfance (First Steps for Children or 3PE) association. Its mission is to promote equal education opportunities through solidarity initiatives, such as the payment of school fees and supply provision for children. Association President Akilou Demon told media outlet Ledefenseur:\n\nNous voulons que tous les enfants aient accès à l’éducation, car l’enfant a droit à l’école. Si certains en sont privés, ce n’est pas juste. Notre ambition est de leur donner une chance égale de réussir et de contribuer demain au développement de notre patrie.\n\nAs children have the right to attend school, we want all children to have access to education. Some are deprived, and this is not fair. We aim to give them equal opportunities to succeed and one day contribute to our country’s development.\n\nAlthough the results of various reforms are visible, shortcomings remain in Togo’s education system.\n\nSchool infrastructure, such as classrooms, is substandard, especially in villages. Students study in straw huts with few school benches (supplemented in some places with bricks) and are forced to move or interrupt their lessons due to adverse weather conditions. In 2021, these circumstances led to construction plans for 30,000 classrooms equipped with wooden class benches. However, in September 2024, the government reduced its improvement projects by more than half, going from 30,000 classrooms to just 14,632.\n\nWhile civil society can offset some of the education system’s shortcomings, it’s ultimately up to the state, which declared education free and compulsory, to improve education quality and train new teachers to achieve equal opportunities for all Togolese children.",

    "title": "In Brazil, Romani people living in peripheral areas fight for recognition of their identities",
    "text": "This article, written by Artur Ferreira and Amanda Oliveira, was originally published on May 30, 2025, on the Agência Mural website. An edited version is published on Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nIn the collective imagination, the Romani people are associated with colourful clothing, parties, accessories, and an aura of mystery, embodying a wandering spirit. But beyond the stereotypes, there is a rich history of resistance and belonging that spans centuries, including in Brazil, in the outskirts of São Paulo.\n\nIn universities, public offices, doctors’ offices, or their traditional campsites, they are fighting for their rights, against prejudice, and for recognition in a country where there are still shortcomings in caring for the diversity of these communities.\n\nIn Itaim Paulista, a neighbourhood at the eastern end of the city, 250 people live in one of the main and oldest Romani campsites in the region.\n\n“Some Romanies palm read, dance, get dressed up in traditional clothing, but some are even evangelical, like myself, and they don’t all even live in camps. We are a people like any other,” the 32-year-old housewife Magda Santos says. She has been living in the camps for eight years with her husband and two children. “I am not Romani by blood, but I became one when I got married to one.”\n\nThe Romani, also known as the Roma peoples, are an ethnic group that doesn’t have a single origin. One of the more widely accepted theories is that they are of Indian origin but have travelled the world since the 11th century in a great diaspora, dispersing throughout the Balkans, Western Europe, and later to other continents.\n\nWhile she was hanging clothes on the clothesline, 29-year-old seamstress Viviane Alves Pereira made sure to find an answer when asked about the main problems her people face. The statement came without hesitation: prejudice, invisibility and the lack of access to basic rights, a common scenario in marginalized neighbourhoods.\n\nWho are the Roma people from the outskirts?\n\nThe majority of Romani who live on the outskirts of Greater São Paulo are of the Calon ethnicity, like Magda and Viviane. They are also those who suffer the most prejudice relating to maintaining their traditions and being most recognized as “gypsies” (a term now considered derogatory), because of their clothing and their nomadic lifestyle, according to sources from this report.\n\nIn Brazil, there are two other Romani ethnic groups: the Roma and the Sinti peoples. They don’t wear traditional clothing, so they mostly go unnoticed in the cities.\n\n“Many Brazilians were already cared for by doctors, nurses and Romani lawyers, and maybe they don’t even know,” states activist Nicolas Ramanush, 64, who is the president of the NGO, Romani Embassy of Brazil (Embaixada Cigana do Brasil), in Santo André in the Greater São Paulo area.\n\n“In the region, Romani people were concentrated in the neighborhood of Itaim Paulista and in the cities of Itaquaquecetuba and Itapevi, with camps near the train stations,” he says.\n\nEach ethnicity is divided into subgroups, and each one develops its own customs, habits, religions and rituals. “In my ethnic group, for example, we always wear decorated shoes with a lot of details. Some Calon women are famous for their flowery dresses and for using handkerchiefs,” says Ramanush, who belongs to the Sinti ethnicity.\n\nThis group has the fewest number of people in the country. “Today, if there are 100 families in Brazil, it is a lot,” says Ramanush. “This is because of the period of Nazism. The Sintis were almost exterminated. Among the Romani killed during the Holocaust, the majority were Sinti and Roma,” he adds.\n\nRamanush notes that many aspects of Romani culture are integrated into the Brazilian lifestyle without most people realizing it. They were among those responsible for helping Carnival to grow, especially in the northeast, creating Carnival street blocks. Certain costumes, such as “La Ursa” (The Bear) in Recife, have a Romani origin.\n\n“Instruments like the seven or six-string guitar were brought to Brazil by the Roma people. Some samba dancers spoke about how living with the Romanies inspired them musically,” Ramanush says.\n\nUnder the canvas tents\n\nNomadic and outskirt-dwelling Romani have a routine defined by difficulties surrounding education for their children and lack of healthcare, caused by the lack of a stable address. They also face São Paulo’s structural problems, such as floods, and living under canvas tents, without safety.\n\nOne of the most impactful natural disasters was the flooding in February 2025 in the far east of São Paulo, in the region known as Jardim Pantanal. The streets and houses remained underwater for several days. The Romani in these camps had to face that situation under the tents.\n\n“We spent days underwater, and it was the neighbors from the region who helped us,” Santos remembers with outrage.\n\nThe camp’s inhabitants had to deal with a lack of drinking water; tents were affected, and according to local accounts, they had to make a joint effort to avoid major losses of furniture and appliances while the flooding advanced.\n\nJust like Santos, Ramanush believes that the first step to improving the Romani community’s life in the outskirts of Brazil is for them not to be invisible.\n\nPrejudice and invisibility\n\nEven with initiatives such as the National Day of Roma Peoples, commemorated every May 24 since 2006, some rights are still neglected. For example, Romani people are not recognized in the national census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).\n\nSantos remembers the difficulty she faced in registering her children’s ethnic group in their identity documents. Since there is no official recognition of “Romani” ethnicity, she ended up registering them by their skin color.\n\n“There are policies catered to Indigenous peoples, Black and Brown people, but not for Romani people. We have our own culture, but we do not show up, which is why I say being Romani is being invisible,” she claims.\n\nRamanush experienced a similar situation when a census taker visited him during the most recent census in Brazil in 2022. “She asked me what my race was, and I answered that it was not on the list. My complexion is white, but I’m a Romani.”\n\nIBGE estimates that Brazil has between 800,000 and a million Romani, but the Roma groups believe the numbers are higher.\n\n“I've already travelled all over Brazil meeting Romani people from all ethnic groups. Without official data, there are no efficient public policies,” Ramanush explains. “Even to count how many Romani there are in each city or town, local governments make the process difficult.”\n\nBesides the lack of recognition, Romani people living in peripheral areas also face a prejudice that runs through generations. They have been accused of theft, robbery, and deception for centuries. It wasn’t rare to have them associated with kidnapping children.\n\nTrying to change this reality and fight prejudice, Romani groups have been mobilized for the approval of a bill making teaching Romani culture and history in schools mandatory — modeling what already happens with Black and Indigenous people in Brazil. The proposal presented by federal deputy Helder Salomão (PT, Workers’ Party), at the Chamber of Deputies as Bill 3547 of 2015, has made little progress.\n\nIn their justification, the text reinforces the idea that for centuries Romani groups have been experiencing prejudice, marginalization, exclusion and persecution. So, the bill aims to “change the image of Romani populations, trying to reduce prejudice and discrimination that these groups are subjected to.”\n\nThe bill also asserts that providing visibility for Romani groups “will provide a more fertile ground to build public policies focusing on the promotion of human rights.”",

    "title": "Cambodian and Thai activists unite to end hostility and promote peace over border disputes",
    "text": "This article was published by Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand. An edited version has been republished by Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement.\n\nBetween July and May 2025, tensions between Thailand and Cambodia over a border dispute devolved into violence that left at least 43 dead on both sides, dozens injured, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Despite signing a ceasefire agreement on July 28, hostility has remained deeply embedded in both countries, fueled by misinformation. Amidst the turmoil, Cambodians and Thais have come together to launch a cross-border campaign aimed at combating hatred and promoting empathy and lasting peace.\n\nThailand and Cambodia share over 700 kilometres of border, where several undemarcated sections have been long-standing sources of conflict between the two countries, since the Preah Vihear dispute beginning in the 1950s, to this year when clashes broke out on May 28th and led to fatalities on July 24th. On top of that, the countries also share historical and cultural ties, which have complicated the tensions between them, leading to deep-rooted hostility between the two peoples.\n\nHostility skyrocketed after the July 24 armed conflict as the conflict between the two governments trickled down to all facets of society. Cambodian and Thai netizens traded accusations on who initiated the clashes.\n\n“We see all the problems start to unfold, and when hatreds, prejudice, and discrimination on people’s level have gone online, it was even more devastating for us, and that's why we decided to come together on the Cambodian side to rally among ourselves,” said Lim Solinn, a Cambodian social activist and artist. She later reached out to friends in Thailand in different places and then stumbled upon a group of Thai people who are a network of solidarity.\n\nOu Tepphallin, a Cambodian labor rights activist and campaign co-organizer, said she joined the campaign to address the suffering of migrant workers and communities caught in the crossfire of recent tensions, particularly Cambodian workers in Thailand and Thai workers in Cambodia.\n\nThey faced physical violence and racism, and they were living with fear, so their voices were unheard. On top of that, children living along the border have lost opportunities to study due to the closure of border crossings. Family members were separated, such as a child whose mother was in Thailand but whose father was in Phnom Penh, and they have no idea when they can be reunited.\n\nIn addition, according to the Thai authorities, the conflict since July 24th has also caused over 500,000 Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand to return home, since most of them felt unsafe and threatened in Thailand. This has left Thailand with a significant labor shortage as Cambodian migrants typically played an essential role in the country's agricultural industry.\n\nSolinn stated that both Thai and Cambodian campaign organizers want the campaign to go viral in both countries and send messages to leaders saying, “Please don't use violence on Cambodian or Thai migrant workers.”\n\nThe campaigners are also trying to figure out catchy ways for this campaign to go viral and reach regular Thais and Cambodians. The campaign includes writing poems and making songs, which they believe could help calm people and encourage them not to hate simply because of what they heard or saw on the news.\n\n“We’re just starting, even if the war ends tomorrow, the hatred continues, so we need to continue this work and reach out to more communities in Cambodia and in Thailand,” said Solinn.\n\nPhallin added that it's time to heal those who suffered from both sides, and that is what the campaign did by starting to send healing messages to ordinary people.\n\nWhen hatred is louder than empathy\n\nIn Thailand, when the armed conflict erupted and innocent Thai civilians and military personnel were killed, many Thai netizens demanded tit for tat retaliation. In addition, right-wing influencers have threatened Cambodian migrant workers and called on patriots to use violence against them.\n\nOften, those who oppose this and call for a peaceful approach face condemnation online for being too optimistic or unpatriotic.\n\n“All the ordinary Cambodians want nothing but peace and harmony with our neighbours, and a lot of people get caught in between these polarizations, and because of the level of their vulnerability, they cannot get their voices heard at all,” noted Solinn.\n\nOn the Cambodian side, Solinn remarked that while they wanted peace and for this war to stop, most Cambodians also became enraged and emotional when they saw news about civilians being affected, schools being bombed, or news that many people were displaced.\n\nShe disclosed that since she and her friends launched the campaign, she has been harassed by netizens from both countries. For her, it has been difficult to get through to people how the hyper-nationalistic, violent narratives are spreading hate. Solinn said:\n\nThey have been misinformed and disinformed. They believe these sets of stories, and they have these perspectives, and it's hard to change. So, instead of trying to tell them a different version, we’re trying to appeal to their consciousness. We try to appeal to their empathy.\n\nEven though most of the information they received was not real, it was effective as it was coupled with prejudice, stereotyping, and hate speech amplified by social media. “It has added fuel to the fire of ultra nationalist perspectives. It just made it really hard for people to try to bridge across for people who are like us,” said Solinn.\n\nShe insisted that engaging with the same outrage and accusing each other of doing what each side thinks is wrong will not improve the situation, particularly for disputes that have been going on for hundreds of years, based on selective history from both sides.\n\nSolinn emphasized that it was time to put people’s lives first. Children should be able to return to school instead of living in refugee camps, families should be able to earn their livelihoods again, and both countries need to recognize the damage the conflict has inflicted on their economies.\n\nA call for peace: rebuilding trust and fostering empathy\n\n“We would like to urge the leaders to sit down and find a peaceful resolution and put the people first,” said Phallin. She also urged the leaders to negotiate and rebuild trust, insisting that peace can be achieved only by negotiation, not war.\n\nIn the meantime, Solinn urged the leaders to be compassionate and gentle and to reach a peaceful resolution, adding that a tremendous amount of strength is required. The campaign organizer also called on leaders on both sides to stop this war and allow everything to return to normal for the sake of the innocent people from both countries.\n\nShe suggested that Thailand and Cambodia stop promoting biases and stereotypes based on selective interpretations of history, particularly for the younger generations.\n\nSolinn also believes that when this war ends, Thais and Cambodians will come together to create mixed communities where people from both sides could share safe spaces and raise awareness of peace and harmony.\n\n“Educating in school or through the media wouldn't be enough. We need all the spaces, all the communities, we need a whole society to heal and to promote racial tolerance, peace, solidarity, and harmony,” said Phallin.\n\nIn terms of media, Solinn said media, particularly mainstream media, in both countries should not amplify hateful rhetoric, which has already been dominant on social media, but rather people’s stories, which would help promote reconciliation and peace, suggesting that selective parts of the history on both sides shouldn’t be allowed to frame the whole narrative about Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nShe noted that we did not know everything, but only heard different sides of the story. Each side believed the other started the war first or believed that the other side encroached upon their land.\n\n“Trust is so fragile. It's so easy to break, and it's broken already. It's very hard to rebuild, but we must try. We do not have a choice,” noted Solinn.",

    "title": "The judiciary’s dilemma: Protecting Nigeria’s whistleblowers without legislation",
    "text": "Nigeria’s whistleblower policy, introduced on December 21, 2016, was designed as a quick fix to expose systemic corruption. It promised whistleblowers between 2.5 and 5 percent of recovered looted public funds. However, while the policy incentivizes disclosures, it does not guarantee protection.\n\nInstead, whistleblowers often face surveillance, dismissal, or even death threats. Multiple attempts to pass a whistleblower protection bill over the years have stalled in Nigeria’s National Assembly, leaving whistleblowers legally vulnerable.\n\nNigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework\n\nOn September 18, 2025, Federal High Court judges and civil society advocates debated on Nigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework at a national interactive forum convened by the African Centre for Media & Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) for federal high court judges, in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city.\n\nHarry Ogwuche, the Director of Economic and Social Rights at Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), shared during the debate:\n\nProtecting whistleblowers is not an abstract anti-corruption strategy; it is a direct, proactive investment in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights as enshrined in Chapter IV of our Constitution and various international covenants Nigeria is party to.\n\nThe role of judges in protecting whistleblowers\n\nWhile seeking the support of judges in the advocacy for a whistleblower protection law in Nigeria, Chido Onumah, Coordinator of AFRICMIL, said:\n\nJudges are key actors in any judicial system. Therefore, the forum aims to provide a platform for interaction with judges on whistleblowing, its legal framework, and the critical role they play in ensuring justice for whistleblowers and handling corruption cases effectively.\n\nAt the forum, persecuted whistleblower Yisa Usman shared how he was pressured, intimidated, and sidelined from his profession after blowing the whistle on his company. Usman is a chartered accountant who worked in the finance and accounts department, but after exposing corruption, he was redeployed to the ICT department, transferred to different states, and subsequently fired. He said:\n\nBecause I decided to speak up, I am jobless. I was ostracized and frustrated to accept the norm. To remain silent is to be complicit. To achieve results as a whistleblower, it is important to be familiar with the laws because if you know the laws that guide and protect you, you will be able to challenge them. Despite several attempts to detain me, I am walking free because of the judiciary.\n\nExisting and pending laws to protect whistleblowers\n\nNigeria’s Constitution and several statutes already contain protections that could be extended to whistleblowers. These include: Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. Section 6(4)(c) of the National Human Rights Commission Act prohibits harassment of individuals who cooperate with the Commission. Anti-corruption laws like the EFCC Act and ICPC Act provide limited safeguards. The Freedom of Information Act protects disclosures made in good faith.\n\nIn practice, these fragmented provisions are inconsistently applied, and without a unified protection law, whistleblowers continue to face retaliation.\n\nNigeria’s situation contrasts sharply with that of its regional neighbors. Ghana’s Whistleblower Act (Act 720) and South Africa’s Protected Disclosures Act provide dedicated mechanisms.\n\nVladimir Radomirović, a Serbian journalist and co-founder of Pištaljka, an organization based in Belgrade that provides free legal aid and protection to whistleblowers, shared his experiences of building alliances with the judiciary to strengthen whistleblower protection in Serbia. He said:\n\nThe judges have a very influential role in protecting whistleblowers in Serbia, and we try to work with judges and allow them to hear from whistleblowers about how they are retaliated against for protecting the public interest.\n\nAFRICMIL and its partners urged the Nigerian legislature to urgently enact the whistleblower protection law, one that guarantees anonymity, provides penalties against retaliation, and establishes an independent body to oversee cases.\n\nWhistleblowers and civil society organizations appealed to judges to embrace a proactive role in safeguarding whistleblowers. They called for progressive adjudication that interprets existing laws in the spirit of transparency and protection for defenders; expedited hearings to ensure justice is not delayed and therefore denied; the awarding of exemplary damages against retaliators to serve as a deterrent; and above all, the protection of anonymity in court procedures. These recommendations, they argued, are vital if the judiciary is to strengthen trust, uphold justice, and ensure that whistleblowing truly serves as a tool for accountability in Nigeria.",

    "title": "Nepal’s Khoj Samachar challenges corruption and empowers youth through digital media",
    "text": "There are nearly 4,900 registered print media outlets in Nepal. Around eighteen news outlets operate exclusively online through digital platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. By law, online media must register with Nepal’s Department of Information and Broadcasting; however, not all outlets currently comply with this requirement.\n\nStanding out among these registered outlets is Khoj Samachar, an independent digital media platform that raises awareness among young people, challenges corruption, and amplifies underrepresented voices in Nepal. Its founder, Roshan Shrestha, is an investigative journalist from Nepal. His approach relies on digital platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and a dedicated app to draw public attention to marginalized stories and pressure authorities to take action. The platform publishes content in Nepali, in both text and video formats.\n\nAbdulrosheed Fadipe of Global Voices interviewed Roshan via WhatsApp to discuss his journey as an investigative journalist and how he uses digital platforms to promote social change, strengthen good governance, and encourage citizen engagement in Nepal.\n\nGlobal Voices (GV): What inspired you to start Khoj Samachar, and what challenges did you face in building it from scratch?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): I started my journalism journey during my school years at Shree Bachchhala Devi Higher Secondary School, Nagpuje, Sindhupalchok District, in Bagmati Province of Nepal. When I was in class 8, a man who was the presenter at Avenues Television came to my school to teach students about journalism. That training programme planted the seed of journalism in my mind.\n\nMy interest in journalism grew after a devastating earthquake occurred in Nepal in 2015. Although the epicenter of the earthquake was located in Gorkha district, many houses in my village, which is located near the Bhotekoshi River, were destroyed. Many people lost their lives. The Tataponi border crossing with China was also closed. I had just completed class 11 then. I was using a simple Android phone because I was from a low-middle-class family that depended on agriculture for a living. With that phone, I started filming and uploading videos of the earthquake's destruction of villages on a YouTube channel. This was how my journalism career began.\n\nIn 2021, I officially launched Khoj Samachar. I did not receive any financial support when I started nor did I have a big team. Now we have a team of four individuals broadcasting news in both English and Nepali.\n\nGV: How do you maintain editorial independence and ensure your outlet's content remains unbiased and free from external influences?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): We do not take money, favors, or support from any political party, business group, or outside donor. From day one, Khoj Samachar has survived only through the income we earn from Facebook and YouTube ads. With those limited earnings, we pay our team and run the entire platform. This is not always easy, but it gives us full freedom. Nobody can tell us what to say or what to hide. We can question leaders, expose corruption, and speak for the people without fear of losing sponsors or upsetting funders. Our only loyalty is to our readers and viewers. For us, independence is more valuable than comfort. Even if the road is difficult, we choose truth over compromise — that is why our content remains unbiased and trusted.\n\nGV: How do you prioritize stories that amplify underrepresented media voices, and what impact do you hope these stories have on your audience?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): At Khoj Samachar, we always give priority to the voices that big media often ignores — farmers, workers, rural youth, and ordinary citizens who face injustice. Many times, people from villages directly contact us to share their pain, because they feel unheard elsewhere.\n\nWe have highlighted stories like that of a person struggling to get a bridge built in his village, a road left unfinished for 10 years, or a family trapped in hardship without support. By showing these issues through videos, we try to bring public attention and pressure the authorities to act.\n\nOur hope is that by giving a platform to these underrepresented voices, young people will feel more connected, more aware, and inspired to raise their own voices. We want our audience to see that journalism is not only about leaders and cities, but also about the real struggles of common people — and that truth can bring real change.\n\nGV: What strategies do you use to reach audiences beyond capital cities, and how do you measure the impact of your reporting in these areas?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): From the beginning, our focus was not only on Kathmandu but also on rural and remote areas. We create stories that reflect the real problems of villages — like missing bridges in Humla, neglected roads in Dailekh, or migrant workers’ struggles. Many of these issues are sent to us directly by local people through phone calls, Facebook messages, or our app. By turning their voices into reports and videos, we make sure their problems are heard nationally.\n\nTo measure impact, we look at the response from citizens and authorities. For example, in Saudi Arabia, when stranded workers contacted us, our coverage led to parliamentary debates and direct government action. Similarly, when we cover local problems, we monitor community feedback in comments, shares, and messages, and also check if the government or local representatives respond. For us, the real impact is when ordinary people feel their voices are finally heard and some positive change begins.\n\nGV: What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced as an independent journalist, and how have you overcome them?\n\nRS: There have been many difficult moments in my journey, but the most painful ones came when some people, who are unable to accept the truth, started abusing my family and even threatened physical attacks in public. As a journalist, I can tolerate criticism and risk, but when my family is dragged into controversy for my work, it is truly unbearable.\n\nSpeaking the truth, especially against corruption and powerful figures, always brings political pressure. Many tried to silence us or scare us into stopping, but journalism loses its meaning if we compromise with fear. What keeps me going is the trust and support of the public and the inner courage to always speak the truth. The emotional burden is heavy, but I continue because ordinary people rely on us to be their voice, and that responsibility gives me the strength to move forward.\n\nGV: How do you envision the future of Khoj Samachar, and what steps are you taking to ensure its sustainability and continued impact?\n\nRS: My main goal is to build Khoj Samachar as a platform based only on truth and facts, not dependent on external funding or political power. The message I want to pass to youth is that they can succeed in journalism by standing for the truth, even if they are alone. I am working to add more features to the Roshan Shrestha App so that it will be useful for the public. This step will help us sustain our work, expand our impact, and keep serving society with independent journalism.\n\nGV: Why did you name the Roshan Shrestha App after yourself?\n\nRS: By putting my own name on the app, I wanted to assure users that this platform is genuine, transparent, and trustworthy. It is not for self-promotion but rather a matter of responsibility: if my name is attached, people know they can rely on it.",

When you fill out the survey, you will also be entered for one of eight chances to win $250! (Everyone who has already filled out the survey will be automatically entered into the draw).\n\nYour voice is critical in shaping the future of ʔaq̓am Own Source Revenue. There is an opportunity to make sure OSR is used strategically now and into the future, as these funds may increase, decrease, or even disappear over time.\n\nThe OSR survey is helping the OSR Committee gauge themes, priorities, and ideas with your direct input. Your participation is supporting policy development, research, and goals.\n\nLink to the survey, open until September 30, 2025:\n\nhttps://forms.office.com/r/uXfzUpbB8A\n\nPrinted versions of the survey are available at the front desk of the Band office.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAfter the survey closes, the OSR Committee and Engagement Coordinator will be in touch to begin booking one-on-one and group sessions. The sessions will involve a deeper discussion and will be held in family/friend/focus groups or individually, if preferred. All Band members 15 and over will have the opportunity to participate once and will be asked the exact same questions.\n\nThe OSR Committee will then follow up with a ‘what we heard’ report and a draft of the policy for community input and feedback.\n\nWhat is OSR?\n\nʔaq̓am OSR are all revenues the Band makes or receives that are not tied to programs or operational funding. OSR originates from various sources, with some directly tied to Title and Rights.\n\nWhy do we need a policy?\n\nThe ʔaq̓am OSR policy is intended to be the voice of the people and a document that outlines how OSR should support community, guided by ka kniⱡwi·tiyaⱡa. ʔaq̓am OSR has the potential to support ʔaq̓amnik̓ for generations to come. That’s why our decisions as a community now will have impacts in the present and into the future.\n\nThe amounts of OSR can increase, decrease, or even disappear over time, but there are many ways it can provide short and long-term benefits if we plan ahead.\n\nWhy not go directly to a vote?\n\nMaking sure our future OSR policy is equitable and transparent is important. The OSR Committee is committed to providing opportunities for everybody to be heard.\n\nMultiple engagements might feel like a lot when other communities have gone straight to vote, but an in-depth process will support a policy that reflects the in-depth voice of our community.\n\nThere are many ways that OSR can be used. A balanced policy will ensure OSR is used in ways that benefit the community as a whole and our members individually, now and for the long-term.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding OSR or the policy development process, please reach out to the OSR Engagement Coordinator.\n\nOSR Engagement Coordinator: Bailey Repp\n\nbrepp@aqam.net\n\n236-361-0110\n\nThe ʔaq̓am OSR Committee",

    "title": "Energy security work continues in three First Nation communities",
    "text": "By Phil Climie, Project Manager, Community Energy\n\nContinuing forward\n\nSince the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Community Energy team’s approach has shifted to supporting projects from afar. As we find ourselves in fall 2020, this project work forges on, largely due to community members stepping into larger roles. While this dynamic asks more of our partners, it supports local development into each project, allowing for a greater focus on each community’s approach.\n\nOne of the many changes the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to us all is the increased time we spend at home. With many people out of work, others working from home, and fewer safe public spaces available, the home has become even more central to our lives. For those who do not have access to safe, affordable, comfortable homes, previously difficult situations can be exacerbated. We know that the people in British Columba who struggle with energy poverty are in these tough situations right now, feeling even more pressure to maintain adequate heating and other basic energy needs for their homes. COVID-19 has highlighted growing disparities in home energy security in BC, furthering the case for expediting justice-based solutions that provide safe, comfortable, and affordable home energy for those who are most impacted.\n\nBelow are three examples of important energy security work that continues to take place in our partner communities this year.\n\nQuatsino First Nation\n\nNorthern Vancouver Island\n\nIn 2019, Quatsino First Nation and Barkley Project Group completed a Community Energy Plan that identified households in their community were spending nearly triple the average BC Hydro customer on electricity. Home energy models and energy audits suggest that each home could save well over $1,000 a year in energy costs by installing ductless air-source heat pumps. Heat pumps significantly decrease the energy demands of the home as they are more than three times more energy efficient than baseboard electric heaters. In addition to reducing consumption, heat pumps circulate warm air more effectively than radiant heaters by cycling air over a heat exchanger and blowing it throughout the homes’ primary living spaces.\n\nIn August 2020, 23 ductless air-source heat pumps were installed in 15 elders’ homes: eight homes received two systems, and seven homes received a single system. The heating contractor — Precise Heating — sized and placed the units according to each homes’ heating needs and the preferences of the occupants. For this phase of installations, elders were given priority by Quatsino Chief and Council to ensure they are best equipped to handle the cold, winter months. In the warmer months, the ‘heat’ pumps have a cooling mode that enables them to function as high efficiency air conditioners, an important benefit expressed by Quatsino leadership due to the hot summer temperatures of their inland location.\n\nHaíłzaqv Nation\n\nBella Bella, Central Coast\n\nThe Heiltsuk Nation continues their ongoing work of replacing oil furnaces with air-source heat pumps in Bella Bella homes. At present, a pilot project for central air-source heat pumps has led to the installation of 60 systems to date. Since central air-source heat pumps utilize ducting from the previous oil furnace systems, they provide opportunities for uniform heating throughout the home.\n\nAs applications for heat pumps come in from community members, it is with little surprise, yet great dismay, to learn of the current heating experiences of many members. Nearly half of all applications received have been classified as ‘critical’ in nature, meaning they have no functioning heating system, or their systems are aging out or unreliable. A remaining majority of applicants fall within the ‘nearing critical’ classification. One other criterion for selection is the cost for some members on fixed incomes, such as Elders or those on disability. The Nation believes that cleaner more affordable heat for its members is a worthy investment and continues to seek funding mechanisms to continue this initiative.\n\nTo ensure that local skills and labour are leveraged throughout the project, the installation contractor for the project — Coastal Heat Pumps — has been training and working with Heiltsuk members on the decommissioning of oil systems, preparation of homes, cleaning of ducting, and installations of heat pumps, since 2018. Pamela Wilson, a member of Heiltsuk Nation and principal at Tagila Consulting, has taken on primary management of the project, with the support of a Heiltsuk Heat Pump working group.\n\n“We all know that one of the greatest challenges on reserve is housing. We have all heard the horrific stories of substandard building materials that have led to dilapidated homes on reserve, we are no exception. The lack of heat goes hand in hand with mould in our homes. One of the elders who was a recent recipient shared that she forgot what it felt like to have a house that was warm in every room, and said that she had to ask her daughter to take her portable heater out of her bedroom as it was a habit for her to turn it on at night before bed. It’s these stories that make this work so rewarding and I am honoured to be a part of it.\n\nThe goal by the end of March 2021 is to have installed 100 heat pumps. Funding the project is like a project in itself. This round of funding that we are currently working with comes from six separate sources. The logistics and reporting requirements for this type of funding structure requires detail and attention and that is where Ecotrust Canada provides expertise in proposal writing as well as management of the overall project, including the collection and record of data management, which will be crucial to reflecting the need in community and justifying future funding applications.”\n\n— Pamela Wilson, Tagila Consulting\n\n‘ N am g is First Nation\n\nCormorant Island\n\nIn 2019, we visited Cormorant Island to meet with ‘ N am g is First Nation, Whe-la-la-u Area Council, and the Village of Alert Bay. From our discussions, we learned about the island’s long-standing struggles with aging heating systems, unmaintained homes, and consequently high energy costs.\n\nRepresentatives from ‘ N am g is First Nation noted that numerous homes had been disconnected from their electricity supply in recent history due to payments in arrears. BC Hydro has a Customer Crisis Fund in place to provide support in these situations, however our research was corroborated by the experiences of ‘ N am g is First Nation staff who have stopped recommending and supporting members’ applications to the program due to low success rates. While BC Hydro did cease all disconnections for three months this summer due to the COVID-19 crisis, as we enter the winter non-payment outages are once again a possibility for homes in economic distress. Our Energy team will continue to advocate for better solutions for those struggling to maintain their homes’ energy supply.\n\nSince meeting last year, Ecotrust Canada and ‘ N am g is First Nation have partnered to complete a Housing Energy Assessment with the purpose of reviewing the current state of housing and energy in the community. With Vancity support, this project will include a survey to gather community feedback, a multi-year analysis of BC Hydro bills, and the construction of home energy models in RETScreen Expert. Together, these elements will help determine the costs and benefits of different project opportunities that improve energy security.\n\nUnderstanding the challenge\n\nAs the days shorten and temperatures drop, the Community Energy team is thinking about the hundreds of thousands of people who are living in energy poverty. Energy poverty is a pervasive issue throughout BC that has significant effects on health and well-being. During our work in late 2019 with the Regional District of Mount Waddington, we identified that one in three residents face challenges paying their home energy bills, and one in five residents have been forced to forgo other basic needs such as food, clothing, and transportation to meet payments — and this was before the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWith governments speaking more about energy efficiency and retrofit economies, our team is encouraged by the increased attention toward addressing factors that contribute to energy poverty. We will continue to advocate for culturally appropriate home energy solutions that reduce energy costs, improve comfort, and stimulate local economies while reducing demands on natural resources and harmful effects on the planet. British Columbia is ready for an increased commitment to alleviating energy poverty altogether, and the province’s rural, remote, and Indigenous communities are prepared to participate.",

    "text": "Premier John Horgan announced Wednesday measures brought in by BC Hydro to address the economic impacts of COVID-19 — including a universal one per cent reduction in rates for all customers.\n\nResidential customers who have lost jobs or had wages reduced as a result of COVID-19 will receive a credit worth three times their average monthly bill over the past year. It will not have to be repaid.\n\nSmall businesses forced to close as a result of COVID-19 will have their April to June 2020 bills forgiven.\n\nBC Hydro will also give the option of a three-month deferment to large businesses.\n\nMajor industry partners, including pulp mills and mines, will be able to defer 50 per cent of their bill for three months.\n\nWatch Premier John Horgan address economic anxieties:\n\nPremier Horgan: ‘Anxiety is high’ Duration 1:02 B.C. Premier John Horgan says it’s going to take ‘extraordinary resilience from British Columbians to get through’ the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSmall businesses will be able to apply starting the week of April 14. Customers have until June 30 to apply.\n\n\"These initiatives are in place for today, not for forever and we will be able to guide British Columbians as we get closer to bending that curve,\" said Horgan.\n\n\"We will do everything we can to support them.\"\n\n$477 reduction for average out-of-work residential customer\n\nMinister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources Bruce Ralston said the rate reduction is the first rate decrease \"in decades,\" and is not a result of COVID-19.\n\nA written statement from the province said the average residential customer's bill is $159 per month, and the average credit provided will be $477. Some customers may also be eligible for BC Hydro's existing Customer Crisis Fund, which provides access to grants of up to $600 to pay their bills.\n\nThe average bill savings for small businesses who qualify will be $121 per month, so the average total bill savings would be $363.\n\nBC Hydro has also halted all service disconnections for non-payment during COVID-19 and cancelled all non-emergency planned power outages affecting its customers.\n\nRalston said the cost of the programs targeted toward residential customers and small business will cost between $80 and 90 million.\n\nHorgan said the BC Utilities Commission is in discussions with FortisBC — a private utility company that provides natural gas and electricity to B.C. residents — about what reductions they will be offering to customers, and that its program will likely mirror what is being done by BC Hydro.\n\nIf you have a COVID-19-related story we should pursue that affects British Columbians, please email us at impact@cbc.ca.",

    "title": "How a justice-based approach to home retrofits can help end energy poverty",
    "text": "By Dylan Heerema, Senior Analyst and Researcher\n\nCanadians spend as much as 90% of their lives indoors, so it’s no surprise that draughty, inefficient housing contributes to a whole host of problems, such as mould and moisture, and corresponding health issues including asthma, cardiovascular disease, and increased vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19. Nowhere are the impacts of energy-inefficient housing more pronounced than in low- and middle-income households, where limited funds for upgrades and higher energy bills create a vicious circle that only serves to perpetuate energy poverty — which now afflicts over 2.8 million Canadian households.\n\nWhat are the equity and justice implications of energy access and use in the home? At Ecotrust Canada, our Community Energy team has been exploring this question through the lens of energy poverty, and the drivers of lack of access to affordable energy services. This year, we produced research reports on the impact of energy poverty on rural, remote, and Indigenous communities in BC, as well as on the need for sustained, meaningful bill protections for the most energy-vulnerable households.\n\nBill protections, designed to offset energy costs for vulnerable customers, are only one part of the solution. A complete policy approach to ending energy poverty must also include strategies for raising wages and creating more secure employment — now more than ever as we rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also a third part of the equation, which relates to the way we use energy in our homes and buildings. This work is often simply labelled ‘energy efficiency’, yet it’s important to remember that there is much more than efficiency at stake when we consider the related impacts to the comfort and safety of our homes.\n\nUpcoming energy efficiency research\n\nThis winter, we will be teaming up with the Canadian Urban Sustainability Practitioners (CUSP) Network and UBC’s Sustainability Scholars Program to conduct the next phase of our research into energy poverty. We are excited to welcome Laura MacTaggart, on board from UBC as a student researcher, as she investigates how a new generation of energy efficiency and retrofit programming could help bring healthier homes and reduced energy bills to those that need them most.\n\nHome energy retrofits = job creation\n\nThe benefits of retrofitting homes, to make them energy efficient and low-carbon, is a critical pathway to reducing carbon emissions, and an effective job creator and boost for economic activity. For example, every $1M invested in programs that support home energy retrofits creates between 16-30 jobs, a far greater number than most other sectors including resource extraction. This is one reason why Canada’s Task Force for a Resilient Recovery, among other groups, are recommending tens of billions of dollars in new funding for retrofits as part of an economic recovery strategy. Yet, we rarely consider who stands to benefit from such investments, and who is at risk of being left behind.\n\nEnergy programs are missing the mark\n\nIn British Columbia, for example, since 2008 the Energy Conservation Assistance Program has offered free energy efficiency upgrades for income-qualifying households. Unfortunately, this program has not achieved widespread adoption or significant bill savings. Only around 5% of the 350,000 households eligible for ECAP have participated in the program to date. Uncovering the reasons for this low uptake will be a major part of this new research, but limited awareness and low cost savings are among the contributing factors. Of households that do participate in ECAP, the average bill savings has amounted to less than $100 per year. These savings are largely insignificant when compared to the steady rise in energy costs in BC, particularly electricity prices, which have increased by almost 50% in the last decade. Such programs, while undoubtedly delivering positive outcomes for some participants, cannot deliver impacts at the scale needed to eliminate energy poverty in their current form.\n\nMore recently, programs designed to help cover the costs of highly efficient appliances, like air source heat pumps, have been introduced by some provinces. In BC, this includes the Indigenous Community Heat Pump Incentive, and rebates offered through Better Homes BC. Unfortunately, many rebates are only available to those who are switching from natural gas or oil to an electric heat pump, leaving many low-income households that rely on inefficient electric baseboard heaters ineligible. Without rebates to help cover the initial cost, heating system retrofits — and the savings that come with them — remain out of reach for many households.\n\nThe current focus among policymakers is on electrification of buildings, which is a necessary step toward addressing climate change, but on its own will not be enough to lift all Canadians out of energy poverty.\n\nThe scale of current low-income energy programs is not adequate. BC Hydro, for example, currently spends between $6-8M per year on its low-income efficiency programs. Yet, providing meaningful upgrades to all eligible low-income customers in BC would likely require billions of dollars of public investment over the coming decades, as well as innovative new options (like the PACE model) for financing retrofit projects. Despite the enormity of this challenge, the current pandemic is teaching us that letting the most vulnerable live in unhealthy and unaffordable conditions could have a more profound negative impact on our health care system, human lives, and the very fabric of our society.\n\nA social justice-based program is needed\n\nRethinking home energy retrofit programs in BC and making progress on eliminating energy poverty is not simply a matter of increasing funding for existing programs. Systemic issues, like social and racial inequity, power dynamics, and a lack of accountability, must be addressed. Poorly-designed programs can also introduce other barriers to participation, including lack of awareness, administrative confusion, and mistrust of service providers. A holistic, justice-based program approach is needed: one that ensures that energy access is affordable and safe for everyone. Our latest research will look at new models for program design and delivery, incorporating lessons and examples from the most successful programs across North America. We look forward to sharing this work with you as it unfolds.",

    "text": "Saskatchewan farmers say drought conditions in some parts of the province are the worst they have seen in decades and higher operating costs these days will make it harder to bounce back.\n\nFields in some southern parts of the province are so parched that seeds have failed to germinate, leaving some farmers with little or no hay for feed.\n\nSome areas have seen less than 100 millimetres of moisture since April, according to the latest crop report.\n\nAlan Dumontel is a semi-retired farmer whose son and daughter-in-law manage cattle in one of the worst-affected areas near Frontier, Sask., about 400 kilometres southwest of Regina.\n\nNot the 1st drought\n\nHe remembers bouts of dry conditions in the 1960s, '70s and '80s but said farmers had gotten used to higher-than-average rainfall in the past 15 to 20 years.\n\nDumontel said it was a shock to go back to drier conditions.\n\n\"It's new to the young people but it's not new to us,\" said Dumontel.\n\n\"We've seen this before many times, it's just kind of a bit uncommon to have 27 inches of rain last year and back up with a drought here.\"\n\nA map that illustrates the cumulative rainfall, or lack thereof, from April 1 to July 10 in Saskatchewan. (Government of Saskatchewan )\n\nToo wet, then too dry\n\nDumontel said wet, muddy conditions at the start of the season left his family with a window of only a week to seed their fields.\n\nSince then, he said it has been so dry that the seeds in his field never got enough moisture to germinate.\n\nAlthough he has been through drought before, he expected that higher operating costs would make it tougher for farmers in the worst-hit areas to recover.\n\n\"The problem is now you need a lot more money to operate these operations and it's not the same as it was in the dry years before,\" said Dumontel.\n\n\"You know, we always had expenses but they are not like they are now.\"\n\nCattle farmers feeling the pinch\n\nHe said operating expenses had risen with higher incomes over the years but this year's drought conditions would make it tougher for some to keep up with those costs.\n\nDumontel predicted cattle farmers would be worst affected because they have mouths to feed at a time when hay will be more scarce and more expensive.\n\nPioneer Co-op agronomist Eric Oliver said cattle ranchers were already feeling the pinch, with a combination of hay expenses and water issues.\n\nDry conditions bring the risk of toxic blue-green algae developing in dugouts, and salinity problems that can be fatal to livestock if left unchecked.\n\nEarlier this month, 200 animals in a grazing pasture near Shamrock, Sask., died from a combination of dehydration, poor water quality and heat.\n\nWater issues\n\nOliver said addressing serious water-quality problems could be costly.\n\n\"They're going to have to either move cattle to a different location where there is water or haul water to them,\" he said.\n\nOliver also noted the stark contrast between current conditions and the wet conditions earlier this year that forced some farmers to seed later than usual, only to find their crops parched within a matter of months.\n\n\"For those crops that are very severely affected, it's game over for this year. It's next-year country, so they're just trying to salvage what they can,\" he said.\n\nCanola a fragile crop\n\nFor those farmers whose crops are still standing, the yield might still be disappointing.\n\nMichel Lepage grows canola, wheat and barley on about 800 acres near St-Denis, Sask.\n\nHe said canola is a more fragile crop that needs more moisture to produce properly.\n\n\"The wind, the heat will limit the time that the crop has to flower,\" said Lepage.\n\n\"And if it doesn't flower long enough then the pods that the flowers produce will be less numerous and won't be as big, so they won't produce as much.\"",

(Government of Saskatchewan )\n\nToo wet, then too dry\n\nDumontel said wet, muddy conditions at the start of the season left his family with a window of only a week to seed their fields.\n\nSince then, he said it has been so dry that the seeds in his field never got enough moisture to germinate.\n\nAlthough he has been through drought before, he expected that higher operating costs would make it tougher for farmers in the worst-hit areas to recover.\n\n\"The problem is now you need a lot more money to operate these operations and it's not the same as it was in the dry years before,\" said Dumontel.\n\n\"You know, we always had expenses but they are not like they are now.\"\n\nCattle farmers feeling the pinch\n\nHe said operating expenses had risen with higher incomes over the years but this year's drought conditions would make it tougher for some to keep up with those costs.\n\nDumontel predicted cattle farmers would be worst affected because they have mouths to feed at a time when hay will be more scarce and more expensive.\n\nPioneer Co-op agronomist Eric Oliver said cattle ranchers were already feeling the pinch, with a combination of hay expenses and water issues.\n\nDry conditions bring the risk of toxic blue-green algae developing in dugouts, and salinity problems that can be fatal to livestock if left unchecked.\n\nEarlier this month, 200 animals in a grazing pasture near Shamrock, Sask., died from a combination of dehydration, poor water quality and heat.\n\nWater issues\n\nOliver said addressing serious water-quality problems could be costly.\n\n\"They're going to have to either move cattle to a different location where there is water or haul water to them,\" he said.\n\nOliver also noted the stark contrast between current conditions and the wet conditions earlier this year that forced some farmers to seed later than usual, only to find their crops parched within a matter of months.\n\n\"For those crops that are very severely affected, it's game over for this year. It's next-year country, so they're just trying to salvage what they can,\" he said.\n\nCanola a fragile crop\n\nFor those farmers whose crops are still standing, the yield might still be disappointing.\n\nMichel Lepage grows canola, wheat and barley on about 800 acres near St-Denis, Sask.\n\nHe said canola is a more fragile crop that needs more moisture to produce properly.\n\n\"The wind, the heat will limit the time that the crop has to flower,\" said Lepage.\n\n\"And if it doesn't flower long enough then the pods that the flowers produce will be less numerous and won't be as big, so they won't produce as much.\"",

    "text": "Saskatchewan farmers say drought conditions in some parts of the province are the worst they have seen in decades and higher operating costs these days will make it harder to bounce back.\n\nFields in some southern parts of the province are so parched that seeds have failed to germinate, leaving some farmers with little or no hay for feed.\n\nSome areas have seen less than 100 millimetres of moisture since April, according to the latest crop report.\n\nAlan Dumontel is a semi-retired farmer whose son and daughter-in-law manage cattle in one of the worst-affected areas near Frontier, Sask., about 400 kilometres southwest of Regina.\n\nNot the 1st drought\n\nHe remembers bouts of dry conditions in the 1960s, '70s and '80s but said farmers had gotten used to higher-than-average rainfall in the past 15 to 20 years.\n\nDumontel said it was a shock to go back to drier conditions.\n\n\"It's new to the young people but it's not new to us,\" said Dumontel.\n\n\"We've seen this before many times, it's just kind of a bit uncommon to have 27 inches of rain last year and back up with a drought here.\"\n\nA map that illustrates the cumulative rainfall, or lack thereof, from April 1 to July 10 in Saskatchewan. (Government of Saskatchewan )\n\nToo wet, then too dry\n\nDumontel said wet, muddy conditions at the start of the season left his family with a window of only a week to seed their fields.\n\nSince then, he said it has been so dry that the seeds in his field never got enough moisture to germinate.\n\nAlthough he has been through drought before, he expected that higher operating costs would make it tougher for farmers in the worst-hit areas to recover.\n\n\"The problem is now you need a lot more money to operate these operations and it's not the same as it was in the dry years before,\" said Dumontel.\n\n\"You know, we always had expenses but they are not like they are now.\"\n\nCattle farmers feeling the pinch\n\nHe said operating expenses had risen with higher incomes over the years but this year's drought conditions would make it tougher for some to keep up with those costs.\n\nDumontel predicted cattle farmers would be worst affected because they have mouths to feed at a time when hay will be more scarce and more expensive.\n\nPioneer Co-op agronomist Eric Oliver said cattle ranchers were already feeling the pinch, with a combination of hay expenses and water issues.\n\nDry conditions bring the risk of toxic blue-green algae developing in dugouts, and salinity problems that can be fatal to livestock if left unchecked.\n\nEarlier this month, 200 animals in a grazing pasture near Shamrock, Sask., died from a combination of dehydration, poor water quality and heat.\n\nWater issues\n\nOliver said addressing serious water-quality problems could be costly.\n\n\"They're going to have to either move cattle to a different location where there is water or haul water to them,\" he said.\n\nOliver also noted the stark contrast between current conditions and the wet conditions earlier this year that forced some farmers to seed later than usual, only to find their crops parched within a matter of months.\n\n\"For those crops that are very severely affected, it's game over for this year. It's next-year country, so they're just trying to salvage what they can,\" he said.\n\nCanola a fragile crop\n\nFor those farmers whose crops are still standing, the yield might still be disappointing.\n\nMichel Lepage grows canola, wheat and barley on about 800 acres near St-Denis, Sask.\n\nHe said canola is a more fragile crop that needs more moisture to produce properly.\n\n\"The wind, the heat will limit the time that the crop has to flower,\" said Lepage.\n\n\"And if it doesn't flower long enough then the pods that the flowers produce will be less numerous and won't be as big, so they won't produce as much.\"",
