    "text": "Today, Global Voices is launching a donation campaign to raise USD 250,000 to keep our news and translation sites running.\n\nHistorically, Global Voices has been primarily supported by foundations and other grant-makers, and we’re grateful for the funding we receive that way. But sharp cuts to foreign aid by a number of governments are shrinking the available funds for nonprofits, with digital rights organizations like ours taking a particular hit.\n\nAnd it’s a hard time for news and translation organizations right now, with new technologies being used to cut staff and mass-produced disinformation crowding out quality news. Even in this challenging time, Global Voices’ production and readership have been going up, but since we are committed to never paywalling and not showing ads, that doesn’t translate into covering our running costs unless readers donate.\n\nGlobal Voices is a relatively low-cost organization to run: we have no office, no rent, and few physical supplies. We pay for the servers that host our site and a few other administrative costs, but by far the majority of our expenses are for paying our staff. Many grants don’t want to fund more than a small percentage of personnel costs, because they want to pay directly for activities, but personnel costs are the basis of all our activities. Our staff and our volunteers research stories, write and edit, translate and advocate — and sometimes they also do graphic design or photo choice, social media promotion, and more. That is who we’re trying to support with the funds from this campaign — our community, the people who make the articles and essays, translations, research reports, and podcasts that you find on our site.\n\nIf we had a dollar for every page view of the site, we wouldn't need to do a campaign! And if each of those dollars were a monthly commitment, we’d be able to plan ahead for longer-term activities and be generally less stressed. But we know that not everyone can contribute for lots of different reasons, so instead we can think about it as five dollars from one-fifth of the monthly site visits, or ten dollars from one-tenth, and maybe someone who hasn't read anything this month but believes in what we do kicks in twenty-five bucks, and someone else who loves translations sends another fifteen and… you get the idea.\n\nWe hope that you can be one of those contributors, and if you can’t right now, we hope you still come and spend time on our site, and then tell other people about it. Even more than a news site, Global Voices is a community, and we’d like you to be a part of it. We’ll be sharing about the campaign and about Global Voices on social media, so please repost so more people learn about us and how they can get involved. Thank you for your support!\n\nDonate",

    "title": "The paradox of women’s rights in Peru",
    "text": "By Grecia Flores Hinostroza\n\nIn Peru, women’s rights exist in a strange paradox: on paper, we have the laws, the representation, and the international commitments that promise equality; in reality, our lives tell a different story. Political progress coexists alongside persistent neglect, with numbers that flatter and figures that fail. This contradiction is not hidden in the shadows — the painful contrast is written plainly in the numbers we so proudly display.\n\nAccording to the SDG Gender Index, Peru scores 72.9 for “Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments,” a figure that suggests progress, visibility, and leadership. And yet, when we shift our gaze to health, the score drastically drops to 35.5, barely half. Women are present in Congress, but absent from the healthcare system that should protect them.\n\nIf political participation alone were enough, our streets would be safer, our hospitals accessible, and our voices heard beyond the voting booth. But in Peru, as in much of Latin America, representation has not broken the chains of inequality — it has simply made them less visible to those who govern.\n\nThe data tells one story. The lives of rural, Indigenous, and poor women tell another — one where access to basic sexual and reproductive health services is a distant reality. Where hospitals, experts, and care are unreachable. As the political scientist Stéphanie Rousseau notes in “The Politics of Reproductive Health in Peru,” “Although health sector reforms have had some positive impact on women’s reproductive health, the many restrictions placed on women’s right to reproductive choices have blocked further progress.”\n\nThe consequences are not abstract. In 2020, Peru’s maternal mortality ratio stood at 69 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the World Health Organization, far above the Latin American average of 45 and nearly five times that of Chile (16) and Uruguay (13). These numbers represent women whose lives could have been saved by timely care, safe births and the fulfilment of rights already recognized by law.\n\nBut these injustices are not only moral failures; they are legal betrayals. Peru has signed its name beneath international promises: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and others. These are not distant treaties gathering dust in diplomatic archives. They are binding commitments, written to safeguard the dignity, health, and safety of women — commitments meant to reach every hospital room, courtroom, and remote village in our country.\n\nLaws protecting sexual and reproductive health rights exist on paper, but they remain distant from the realities of rural, Indigenous, and poor women. Clinics lack essential services. Comprehensive reproductive care is unavailable. Legal frameworks declare equality, but equality disappears in places where women still face forced pregnancies, unsafe births, and systemic neglect.\n\nThe Constitution speaks of equality, but equality does not walk the roads where women carry their pregnancies alone. The Ministry of Health issues protocols, but those protocols do not save lives when the nearest health centre is closed, or when the only doctor is gone. Rights without access are hollow. Commitments without implementation are betrayal.\n\nIn this context, political representation must not be mistaken for liberation. We cannot accept the illusion of progress that comes from more women in office if it is not matched by concrete action to dismantle structural barriers. Empowerment is not an empty slogan — it is the lived reality without fear, accessing healthcare without barriers, and raising one’s voice without retaliation.\n\nThe gap between law and life is not an abstract policy flaw; it is a daily crisis. It is the young girl in a rural province forced to give birth after sexual assault because abortion is inaccessible. It is the mother who dies on the way to a hospital that never has the capacity to treat her. Likewise, it is the Indigenous community where reproductive rights exist only in the language of faraway courts, not in the practice of local healthy systems.\n\nIf we measure success only by the presence of women in power, we ignore the absence of justice in their communities. Numbers in parliament cannot compensate for empty maternity wards. International recognition cannot replace the right to safe childbirth.\n\nI call on the Peruvian Congress to legislate not for appearances, but for autonomy. To ensure that health, safety, and dignity are realities in every province. I call on international donors to fund the fight for reproductive freedom, not just political participation. And I call on Peruvian society to recognize that representation without rights is no victory at all.\n\nRepresentation matters. But it is only the beginning. Real empowerment is when every woman controls her future — her body, her health, her voice — regardless of where she was born or how far she lives from the capital. Until the day, the paradox will remain, and progress will be a promise half-kept.",

    "title": "Pro-government campaign against student protests attempts to justify repression in Serbia",
    "text": "This analysis by Nataša Stanojević was originally published by the International and Security Affairs Centre (ISAC), part of the regional initiative Western Balkans Anti-Disinformation Hub. An edited version is republished by Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nThe protest held on June 28 this year in Belgrade, on the Serbian national and religious holiday, Vidovdan, represented the culmination of months of public discontent with government policies and systemic societal problems.\n\nVidovdan is deeply rooted in national history and collective memory and has often been used as a symbol of political and moral struggle. In this case, students and other citizens chose the date to underscore the seriousness of their demands for responsible governance, to call for snap elections, and advocate for essential institutional reforms.\n\nAccording to estimates, the protest gathered around 140,000 people, making it one of the largest political gatherings in the past decade. The sheer size of the turnout reflects profound social frustration and a sense that institutional mechanisms for expressing discontent have completely failed. However, while the organizers’ demands were clearly defined — fighting corruption, institutional accountability, and democratization of the system — pro-government media constructed an entirely different picture.\n\nInstead of fact-based reporting, the public sphere was flooded with sensationalist headlines and claims aimed at delegitimizing the protests and criminalizing participants. The student movement and citizens were not portrayed as advocates of democratic values, but as a threat to the stability of the state. This strategy of criminalization, typical of authoritarian regimes, allowed the authorities to justify the use of force and intensified repression.\n\nPro-government media in Serbia systematically employ false and manipulative narratives to discredit legitimate civic protests and normalize the state’s repressive responses. Analysis shows that key propaganda tactics include labeling participants, manipulating events, constructing an image of a foreign enemy, and glorifying police force. These practices have long-term consequences for democratic processes and freedom of expression.\n\nInstruments of the propaganda narrative\n\nOne of the most commonly used strategies was the deployment of pejorative labels. Organizers and participants were not referred to as students or citizens but as “blockaders,” “hooligans,” and “terrorists.”\n\nA headline in the tabloid newspaper Informer, “Anti-hooligan operation in the city center: Watch how blockaders are arrested,” illustrates how police intervention was presented as necessary and legitimate, while citizens were criminalized. The term “terrorists” carries particularly strong connotations, suggesting extremism, even though the protests were peaceful in nature.\n\nMedia outlets widely circulated narratives about an alleged “hellish plan” by demonstrators. Headlines such as “Bridges and the entire city under siege: The new hellish plan of blockader terrorists, they want blood and dead bodies on the streets!” create an atmosphere of fear and suggest inevitable escalation into violence. These unfounded claims serve to mobilize the government’s loyal voter base and legitimize repressive measures. Rhetoric about “blood on the streets” and “danger to citizens” not only criminalizes protest participants but also frames them as a national security threat.\n\nPro-government discourse attributed goals to the protesters, such as “destroying the state” and “overthrowing the president.” These claims are not based on any documents or public statements by organizers, whose demands focused on improving safety, fighting corruption, and ensuring political accountability. Introducing accusations of “treason” and “collaboration with enemies” is part of a broader model of political propaganda in which social resistance is portrayed as a conspiracy against national interests.\n\nWhile pro-government media insisted on an image of violent demonstrations, actual events tell a different story. According to reports from independent media and human rights organizations, the majority of the protest was peaceful. This was also confirmed by the Council of Europe.\n\nThe few incidents that occurred happened only after police intervention, during which excessive force was used. The arrests or detentions of hundreds of people, along with documented cases of physical abuse, clearly show that state repression was the dominant dynamic. This gap between the media narrative and empirical facts is a classic example of the framing technique — selective presentation of reality to shape public opinion.\n\nThe broader political context and the foreign enemy narrative\n\nParticularly concerning is the strategy of linking the protests to alleged foreign enemies, in this case, Croatia. Certain tabloids and politicians suggested that the organizers of the protests were instruments in the hands of Croatian intelligence structures and that their goal was the destabilization of Serbia. These claims have no factual basis, but serve a clear propaganda purpose: to evoke historical tensions and use national stereotypes to create a sense of threat among citizens. (The hostilities between Serbia and Croatia have deep roots in their national narratives. These tensions began during the Ottoman Empire when many Serbian refugees were settled in Croatia by the Austrian authorities. The animosity intensified during World War II when Croatia joined the Axis powers, and was solidified during the wars that accompanied Yugoslavia’s breakup. This period culminated in Operation Storm, which resulted in the majority of Serbs fleeing Croatia.)\n\nThe use of Croatia in this narrative has a dual function: first, to mobilize patriotic sentiment; by suggesting that the protests are connected to a “hostile state,” the government reinforces its image as the defender of national interests. Second, it discredits the opposition and civic initiatives; by attributing “foreign influence” to the protests, the government delegitimizes their goals and diverts attention from internal problems such as corruption and institutional breakdown. This rhetoric relies on the well-known model of “constructing a foreign enemy,” which, according to political communication theory, serves to homogenize the electorate and justify authoritarian practices.\n\nA particularly alarming segment of the propaganda campaign concerns the linkage of protests with the issue of Srebrenica. (The 1995 massacre of the Muslim population in Srebrenica and its surrounding areas by the Army of Republika Srpska is frequently exploited by both nationalist and anti-Western factions in Serbia. Similar to narratives that deny the Holocaust, discussions about Srebrenica range from complete denial to unsettling debates about the number of victims, their nationality, and the use of terms like “necessary military action” and “collateral damage.” Over the past 15 years, anyone who does not support these narratives has been labeled a “traitor” or a “Western agent” in official political discourse.)\n\nIn an Informer article entitled “They’ve exposed themselves! This is blockader politics: Accusing Serbia of a nonexistent genocide in Srebrenica,” students were accused of “agreeing with accusations that brand Serbs as a genocidal nation.” This narrative attempts to shift the focus from demands for democratization to a national question, creating the impression that the protests have an “anti-Serbian agenda.” In this way, civic resistance is criminalized through manipulation of one of the most emotionally charged issues in the public sphere.\n\nA similar rhetoric is used by the portal Vaseljenska in the article “Blockaders want to declare Serbs a genocidal nation: Elections, then a government that will recognize the genocide in Srebrenica.” These claims are absent from any official demands of the organizers, but their function is clear: to discredit the protests by linking them with alleged plans to “betray national interests.” Thus, the government constructs a narrative in which students are not only “hooligans” but also agents of dangerous ideological and political projects.\n\nNarrative vs objective facts\n\nIn the long term, such practices lead to the consolidation of authoritarian patterns of governance. When every criticism of regime representatives is labeled as “treason” or “terrorism,” the space for democratic dialogue disappears. This not only delegitimizes protests but also undermines the fundamental values on which modern democratic societies rest.\n\nThis analysis of the media narrative surrounding the Vidovdan protests demonstrates that pro-government media act as a propaganda apparatus whose primary function is the preservation of political power, not informing the public. Through the dissemination of a distorted perception of civic resistance, the construction of violent scenarios, and the invention of foreign enemies, the authorities succeed in delegitimizing valid social demands and justifying repressive measures. Such a strategy may stabilize the regime in the short term, but in the long run, it erodes the foundations of democracy and leads to further political and social crises.",

    "text": "This Dart Centre Asia Pacific Report by Arun Karki was originally published in Nepali Times, and an edited version has been republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.\n\nWhat should a journalist do when young protesters are shot in front of her? Does she do her job and stay neutral? Can you stay neutral?\n\nAs Gen Z protests engulfed Kathmandu, Nepal's journalists found themselves reporting a story that was personal. While doing their job, some of them were even targeted by mobs.\n\nRead More: Gen Z stands up to expose corruption in Nepal\n\nDart Asia Pacific Fellow Arun Karki visited their newsrooms and spoke with his colleagues about their experience of reporting the Gen Z protests that erupted on September 8th. These are the first-hand accounts of journalists who witnessed the turmoil in the city they call home.\n\nSunita Karki was at a workshop in a hotel on September 8th. She saw the first waves of protests through hotel windows. Curfew alerts flooded her phone, a vehicle belonging to a human rights group sat burning across the road, young boys were taking their wounded friends on motorbikes to local hospitals, and police were beating a teenager with their hands raised.\n\n“I cried a lot,” she said, but the tears were not out of fear — they were because she felt guilt. “I couldn’t write the news. We were witnessing these scenes from a five-star hotel.” By evening, the death toll had reached 19. On September 9th at about 3:35 pm, her outlet, the Annapurna Post's office in Tinkune, Kathmandu, was set on fire. Staff had to leave the building as parts of the newsroom burned down.\n\nWhen she knew her office was burning, she anxiously told her husband that she would resign from the job: “If we have to hide our identification cards in every protest, what kind of journalist am I?” she asked herself.\n\nShe filed a story the next day, but her emotions kept bouncing between those of a journalist bound to duty and a civilian in shock. She said that in moments like this, it’s hard to feel truly neutral.\n\nAfter watching the police beat people, she felt a strong urge to step in, not just stand back and report. The first real calm came later, when people came to the street and lit candles together in honor of those who were killed. “This was a sort of victory procession. I felt some relief after brutal days,” she said.\n\nAngad Dhakal a photojournalist who works at Kantipur National Daily, was standing outside his office building when protesters stormed in and set parts of it on fire. He had already been informed that protesters were planning to torch his office building and rushed to his office hoping to save his hard drives containing ten years of photography work. He failed.\n\nHe raised his camera and “forcefully” pressed the shutter — more to document the scene than out of “professional enthusiasm or duty.”\n\n“My office was burning. What should I photograph?” he recalled. A few moments later, a protester noticed the “PHOTO” label on his yellow Press jacket. Dhakal deflected it by saying he was an early-career freelancer and YouTuber. He went into a corner and took his jacket off so that protesters wouldn't target him.\n\nWhen it comes to covering street protests, Angad usually stands near the police because it feels safer. But on September 8th, fire and gunshots made even that area unsafe. A rubber bullet hit his friend Dipendra Dhungana, badly injuring him.\n\nHe thought, “Where do we go now? If we stay here, we’ll be hit.” After witnessing two days of protests, violence, and killings, and seeing his own office burning, he couldn't sleep for days.\n\nThe same afternoon that government buildings burned and media outlet Kantipur was attacked, a message in a protest Discord forum talked openly of “attacking Kantipur.”\n\nRumors spread to other outlets. Outside OnlineKhabar's office, where Gaurav Pokharel works, the newsroom manager said, “Very suspicious people were walking around.” They lowered blinds, avoided windows, locked the front gate, and dispersed staff to other places across the city. The outlet was threatened and effectively locked down, but not torched.\n\nPokharel hid his press ID. “ I never showed the ID card. Sometimes I had to enter the crowd shouting slogans, just to blend in among the protesters,” he said. He watched people fall under gunfire, and he helped pull one surrounded journalist out of a hostile crowd.\n\nGaurav also contributed articles to international outlets as a freelancer. Later, while transcribing an interview of a young protest organizer, he wrote to his editor at an international outlet: “This was very hard to write. I cried many times while doing it.” He had been working at a stretch for days, battling bouts of exhaustion and low blood pressure.\n\nProtesters vandalized and set fire within the Singha Darbar complex housing Nepal Television and Radio Nepal. They tried to disrupt public broadcasting.\n\nSurendra Paudyal began the day with his press ID hanging on his neck, thinking it would let him move freely. But when he reached Singha Darbar around 3:30 pm, the situation felt dangerous.\n\nHe put the ID in his pocket. When asked what mattered most, he answered without pause: life comes first. In that moment, he felt real fear and a strong duty to protect his team.\n\nHis focus narrowed to basic things: stay calm, find exits, get everyone out safely. Later, they were able to keep the 8 pm news on air through a regional link. He felt mixed emotions and a sense of relief that the broadcast continued, but also sadness and anger that their own studio had come under attack.",

    "title": "The great silence surrounding marital rape in Senegal",
    "text": "By Bowel Diop\n\nGender-based violence, including marital rape, occurs worldwide, and often, the perpetrators are the victim's husband. Marital rape is defined as an act in which one partner forces the other to engage in non-consensual sex. A report by Equality, a US-based organisation with offices in New York, Nairobi, and London, reveals that many women are affected by this phenomenon, including many in Africa.\n\nIn private online forums where women post under anonymity, distressing testimonies emerge about the violence they suffer within relationships. Out of respect and for the protection of those sharing their stories, no names or platform details are revealed. Behind these testimonies emerges a chilling reality: that of sexual relations imposed within marriage without the woman’s consent, in other words, the reality of marital rape.\n\nAs violence against women becomes increasingly common, consent is being trampled. The notion of “conjugal duty” still frequently outweighs a woman’s right to make decisions about her body.\n\nIt is in these digital spaces, where distress is voiced and violence normalized, that discussion groups take shape, embodying a form of digital sisterhood. Providing room for listening, support, and open speech, these spaces enable women to challenge together the taboos that restrict their empowerment, online as well as offline. This safe space where women share their experiences underlines the urgency of an open and courageous debate on marital rape in Africa.\n\nA cultural, religious, and legal debate\n\nIn May 2025, the program “Midi Plus” on TFM Télévision Futur Média, based in Senegal, gave national exposure to Oustaz Modou Fall, a Muslim authority in the country. This preacher claims that conjugal duty takes precedence over consent, thereby legitimizing sexual violence in the name of marriage. Speaking in Wolof, he stated:\n\nGnouni loi bi néna sakh sa diabar so beugué teud akk mom té dacoroul daga ko violé . Pfff wakhi dof ! Sa diabar ga takk ko so farata Yallah akk souna Seydouna Mohamed , touki Pape Samba dem tournage soneu baye beugu dé gnibissi beugu teud ak sokhname gnouniko bouné dama soneu damadone fobéré (rires) ga forcéko viol le. Boudé lou amm la , lane moye texte bi. Si diné.\n\nPeople say the law declares that if you force your wife to have sex, that counts as rape. Pfff — absurd, this is your wife, the one you married before God. You travel, you work, Pape Samba [the host], you come back exhausted, you want to be with your wife, and she refuses. She says she’s tired, that she was doing the housework (laughter). So if you insist, it’s rape? If that’s the case, which religious scripture says so? We must be cautious about this.\n\nThe broadcast immediately sparked indignation across social media. On TikTok, activists and legal experts mobilized. The Xam Sa Droit page published a series of videos challenging Modou Fall’s statements against existing legislation. Specifically, it points to Article 320 of Senegal’s Penal Code, which defines rape as any act of penetration “carried out through violence, coercion, threat or surprise.” This is a reminder that marriage does not take away any fundamental rights, and that refusing sex, even within a couple, remains an inalienable right. This effort at legal education was met with strong support on TikTok, as it put consent back at the center of the discussion.\n\nVoices were also raised on X. Nabou Diop Lo, a lawyer and activist for women’s and children’s rights, posted:\n\nLe viol tel que définit dans le code pénal Sénégalais ne fait pas une distinction entre le viol commis dans le ménage et celui commis hors des liens conjugaux. Tout ce qui compte c'est le consentement de la victime. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nRape, as defined in the Senegalese Penal Code, makes no distinction between rape committed within marriage and that committed outside it. What matters is the victim’s consent. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nBut how can a woman dare complain she's been raped when a religious figure claims that a wife’s “no” carries no weight? This dissonance between the law, public discourse, and women’s lived reality highlights the urgent need for legal reform and a clear stance from the authorities.\n\nBy normalizing marital rape, this official rhetoric entrenches an absolute claim over women’s bodies and heavily compounds the moral weight borne by potential victims.\n\nEquality Now’s 2024 report shows that the legal recognition of marital rape differs significantly across Africa. The report notes that countries such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Madagascar, Senegal, and Togo explicitly criminalize marital rape.\n\nIn countries including Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Tanzania, spouses are explicitly exempted from prosecution, except in exceptional cases.\n\nIn Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mali, Uganda, and Chad, the law remains silent on the matter, creating a complete legal void.\n\nSenegalese law on rape and paedophilia, revised in 2020, sets out the definition of rape as follows:\n\nTout acte de pénétration « commis par violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise ».\n\nAny act of penetration ‘committed by violence, coercion, threat, or surprise.’\n\nHowever, the lack of clear legal provisions on marital rape and spousal consent creates a wide scope for interpretation, often to the detriment of the victim. As a result, marital rape is often treated as an ordinary form of domestic violence, rather than classified as a criminal offence.\n\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, for example, an investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde published in February 2024 reported that a humorous TikTok video mocking women’s sexual fatigue sparked amused reactions — evidence that sexual non-consent is not taken seriously.\n\nAccording to figures published in African Health Sciences, 33 percent of women in Africa have been subjected to sexual violence at some point in their lives, with rates rising to 44 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Côte d’Ivoire, 40 percent of women housed in the shelter run by the NGO Akwaba Mousso say they have suffered marital rape.\n\nIn many African legal systems, including in Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, the implicit presumption of consent between spouses prevents marital rape from being effectively recognised as a crime.\n\nWhen feminists raise awareness on the subject, the issue is frequently minimised. In the previously mentioned Le Monde article, Ivorian activist Marie-Paule Okri, co-founder of the Ivorian League for Women’s Rights, told the journalist:\n\nQuand on essaie d’en parler, on nous répond qu’on exagère. On nous inculque depuis l’adolescence que le corps de la femme est fait pour donner du plaisir à l’homme.\n\nWhen we try to talk about it, we are told we are exaggerating. From adolescence, we are taught that a woman’s body exists to give pleasure to men.\n\nYet Article 14 of the Maputo Protocol commits African states to guaranteeing women’s fundamental rights, including health and reproductive consent.\n\nBeyond legislation, it will take a deep change in attitudes to improve women’s condition, grounded in respect for their bodies and equality in relationships.",

    "text": "On October 7, 2023, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), the group that governs the Palestinian territory of Gaza, breached the barrier that has surrounded the densely populated area for the last 16 years, preventing the free flow of people and goods. The militants then launched an attack on 22 nearby Israeli settlements, towns, and military bases, killing around 1,200 civilians and soldiers and taking at least 199 hostages.\n\nMany governments around the world have condemned the attack as a war crime and act of terror, while other governments blamed Israel for setting the stage for these attacks to take place. Since then, many governments have described Israel’s response as disproportionate: the official death toll now exceeds 40,000 Palestinians killed, including over 15,000 children — some experts estimate the actual number to be over four times higher.\n\nFor more, read Global Voices’ previous Special Coverage: Israel’s war on Gaza\n\nThe assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas Political Bureau, in Tehran on 31 July 2024, and a key Hezbollah military commander in Beirut on 30 July have significantly escalated tensions in the region. These targeted killings, combined with the failure to implement a ceasefire, are raising the risk of a war that could engulf the whole region, with potentially far-reaching consequences for global peace and stability.\n\nIsrael’s actions, including its military occupation, settlement expansion, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and recurrent operations in Gaza and the West Bank, have drawn widespread accusations of human rights violations and defiance of international law. This includes an International Court of Justice (ICJ) initial ruling on an ongoing case finding it plausible that Israel is committing genocide and an application by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for arrest warrants against three Hamas leaders — including Haniyeh — and two Israeli officials — including Prime Minister Netanyahu — for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe arrest warrants include one for Mohammed Deif, Commander-in-Chief of Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. the Israeli army claims to have assassinated Deif in an airstrike on July 13 in the Al Mawasi humanitarian safe zone in Gaza — one that killed at least 90 people in a massacre described by United Nations official Scott Anderson as “some of the most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.”\n\nIsrael's military operations and targeted assassinations in neighboring countries continue despite United Nations Security Council resolutions, global calls for a ceasefire, and repeated condemnations from international humanitarian organizations who have labeled them as violations of international humanitarian law. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached catastrophic levels, with an illegal blockade that has led to severe shortages of vital supplies and the threat of a poliovirus outbreak, exacerbating the suffering of the population, with nine out of 10 people internally displaced, many of them multiple times.\n\nThe international community’s failure to enforce a ceasefire or hold Israel accountable has highlighted the limitations of global institutions in managing the crises. The United Nations has failed to mediate effectively, with its resolutions ignored, and global and regional players have not put pressure on Israel to accept or implement ceasefire resolutions adopted by the UNSC or proposed by mediators. This raises significant questions about the effectiveness of international law in protecting civilians in conflict zones.\n\nIn this special coverage, we explore the regional and global implications as well as the challenges facing international law in addressing the ongoing crisis.",

    "title": "How one community in Trinidad & Tobago pushed the culinary boundaries of pigeon peas",
    "text": "By Natalie Briggs\n\nWhen I first met Florence Warrick-Joseph, there were two things I didn’t know. One, we were related in that pumpkin vine way only Caribbean people can be. Two, the doubles I had just bought from her at a pop-up market had a surprise in them.\n\nIt wasn’t the comforting warmth of a bara hot out of the box, leaking through greaseproof paper. It wasn’t the silken tear of teeth into that just-fried pillowy goodness, which, if you’re lucky, will still hold a hint of the crackle of oil.\n\nNo, it wasn’t that.\n\nIt was the filling. Cucumber, check. Sweet sauce, check. The heady bouquet of garlic, cumin and spices was there. But there was something different in the mouth feel. It wasn’t the melt-in-your-mouth consistency of the channa that makes doubles a national byword in Trinidad and Tobago. Tasty, yes … but different.\n\nThe same bouquet is heavy in Warrick-Joseph’s small kitchen, tickling the nostrils, making me think about the last time I ate. “I don’t curry the peas. I stew it,” she revealed, while demonstrating how she puts her spin on the popular street food. This is not her only departure from the norm. The peas she uses? They are pigeon peas.\n\nThese days, it isn’t quite the record scratch moment it was when it first appeared — but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. What we should be discussing is how pigeon peas, the stuff of pelau and coconut milk stew-downs, ended up in doubles. It started as an exhortation to think outside the box.\n\nIn 2014, Warrick-Joseph, a retired registered nurse, decided to do an event management course. Her lecturer asked the cohort to stretch themselves beyond the ho-hummery of birthday parties and christenings for their practicum. She was an avid planter of pigeon peas, one of the many members of the Upper Cemetery Street Residents’ Association in Diego Martin, to do so. They had a bumper crop that year.\n\n“We were walking back down the hill,” Warrick-Joseph recalled. “Me, Errol [her husband] and Mr. Timothy. And he asked what were we going to do with all these peas. My husband said, ‘We will freeze it, we will sell it.’ Because that is what people do to get money to put in the organisation. So I said, thinking out of the box, we could have a pigeon peas festival.”\n\nThe two men were sceptical. Warrick-Joseph continued, “They were like, ‘Nobody ever heard of a pigeon peas festival.’ I said, ‘I’ve heard of a mango festival. I’ve heard of a breadfruit festival. There’s a chocolate festival. Why not pigeon peas?’”\n\nThe stage was set, but the main players were yet to arrive. They had the peas, but it would literally take a village to showcase their versatility. By the time the first festival rolled around in 2015, it was a result of a true community effort. They were able to generate so many recipes, including a version of doubles, that there were enough to fill a commemorative book.\n\n“We got someone to do pholourie,” Warrick-Joseph said. “We got somebody who could do pigeon peas accra. Everybody ended up taking a recipe. We found people in the community who could do these things. The pigeon peas roti was from a woman who did roti, and instead of using the dhal with the split peas, she used the pigeon peas.”\n\nPholourie? Accra? Roti? It wasn’t such a stretch of the imagination. After all, pigeon peas’ nutty, earthy flavour lends itself well to a variety of savoury preparations. That’s why it’s a perennial favourite across the Caribbean.\n\nBut Warrick-Joseph was about to hit me another curveball. That first festival, she came up with four of her own recipes. One for ice cream. One for a punch. One for a pigeon peas wine. Then one for a liqueur. Two of those are sweet. One of them officially qualifies as dessert. The trick was in picking, shelling and stewing the fresh pigeon peas to form the custard base all within 24 hours, while they were still full of flavour. My mind had more difficulty wrapping around the idea of pigeon peas as this creamy, cold concoction.\n\nThere were no such problems with the muffins. As I stood and watched her prepare them, different scents filled the kitchen, this time with her signature spice blend. It was the spice, I realised, that gave it the illusion of being sweet. I hadn’t seen her put a lot of sugar into the mixture. The eventual result was dense, reminding me more of a coconut drop than the traditional muffin with its cakey crumb. Fresh out of the oven, breaking into one was a treat; I could smell the spices wafting up from the steamy centre. There was nutmeg. Some cinnamon, too.\n\nNothing in the flavour screamed pigeon peas. That was more in the texture and the solidity with which it sat in my stomach. One muffin felt like a full meal, which led me to ask about the nutritional benefits of the pigeon peas substitution. I found out that, among other things, they were high in potassium and fibre, and were good for gut flora, diabetics, and women who wanted to lose weight.\n\nIn fact, it was trying to cater to customers who wanted healthier alternatives to doubles that prompted Warrick-Joseph to come up with a recipe for gluten-free bara, made with pigeon pea flour: “The reason for the switch was that people felt they wanted gluten-free. There was a group of people that was intolerant to normal flour.”\n\nThese were what I had really come to see her prepare, the muffins being a delectable side journey. I knew it would be different from the first doubles I had from her, since the bara in that one had been made the regular way, with flour, leavening agent and oil. How different this version would be, both in taste and feel, was left to be seen.\n\nIt was a three-flour mix, including the ground pigeon peas, which resulted in a tacky, sticky sort of dough that was allowed to rest for about half an hour. While it did that, Warrick-Joseph warmed the oil in which she would fry them later, and prepared the pigeon peas filling. We talked about many things while she did this, including her business and her plans to eventually have pre-packaged products in the supermarket.\n\nWhen she deemed the dough ready, she put the peas aside. The low gluten content made it difficult to handle as it tears easily, which is why she prefers to use a pastelle press to shape them, instead of rolling them out the traditional way. From there, the perfect circles went into the warmed oil, where they puff up slightly — nothing like the regular bara, because of the low gluten content. By the time they are done, I’m itching to try them.\n\nWarrick-Joseph presented them to me on a plate, complete with pigeon peas filling, cucumber and a tangy tamarind sweet sauce. I took a bite, and chewed slowly, trying to make up my mind about them. The verdict? All the elements were there. This tasted like doubles. Purists might draw the line at the bara, which was more reminiscent of a soft taco shell — flatter, with a slight, mealy crunch to it — while health enthusiasts might hail it as the thing to make doubles great again.",

    "title": "Meet Esther, an independent journalist reporting from the frontlines of Myanmar",
    "text": "Exile Hub is one of Global Voices’ partners in Southeast Asia, emerging in response to the 2021 coup in Myanmar, focusing on empowering journalists and human rights defenders. This edited article is republished under a content partnership agreement.\n\nMost people spend their lives running away from danger. Esther ran toward it.\n\nAfter finding refuge in Australia under UNHCR protection, she made the bold decision to return to the Thailand–Myanmar border in 2023 to continue her journalism. Now, in 2025, she reports from one of Myanmar’s most dangerous conflict zones often under fire, often uncertain of tomorrow. Yet she remains unshaken.\n\nIn a world where silence is safe, Esther chooses the frontline. Her weapon is truth, and she wields it for those who cannot.\n\nA journey against the current\n\nBorn in Mon State in 1993, Esther has always been someone who could not ignore injustice.\n\n“I have never been able to lie to myself or live in misery. If something doesn’t sit right with me, I have to face it head-on,” she reflects.\n\nLike many young people in Myanmar, Esther initially wandered through different jobs, unsure of her calling. She translated movies, worked as a travel and tour sales representative, and later became a public relations officer at a Korean company. But none of these roles felt right.\n\n“I couldn’t stay where I felt trapped or compromised,” she shares.\n\nHer turning point came in 2018 when she attended a basic journalism course. “That’s when I realized writing and sharing opinions was what I had always loved. It felt like home.” After the course ended, she landed her first journalism job at an ethnic media house.\n\nWhen the coup changed everything\n\nBy 2021, Esther was working with a major media house. When the coup hit, her newsroom relocated to Karenni State, and Esther went with them, continuing to report under dangerous conditions. But even after escaping to Australia for safety, the pull of truth was stronger than comfort. In 2023, she made the decision to return.\n\nA few months after she arrived in Thailand, the military made a desperate announcement. In February 2024, the military reactivated its conscription law, mandating that men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 serve in the army. Evading service or helping someone evade could lead to five years in prison.\n\n“As the number of these conscription stories grew, so did my determination to report them,” Esther recalls. But working as an exiled independent journalist came with its own struggles. With no regular income and the constant need for resources, continuing her work was a challenge. That’s when she applied for Exile Hub’s Critical Voices Fellowship 2024 and received it.\n\nBearing witness on the frontlines\n\nEsther began collecting stories from those most affected. She spoke with young men who had fled their villages, fearful of being conscripted. She also interviewed women who had watched brothers and husbands taken by the army, leaving families uncertain and anxious about their loved ones’ fate.\n\nIn September 2024, she published “I Don’t Want Others to Face What I Faced: Stories of Forced Military Conscription,” giving a voice to those the regime wanted silenced.\n\nLater, she followed with another hard-hitting piece, “Snatched from Their Beds, Taken on the Streets — The Young Men in Myanmar Forced to Fight the Junta’s Losing War.”\n\nToday, Esther works deep inside one of Myanmar’s most volatile conflict zones, a place where the sound of gunfire and the threat of airstrikes are constant. Despite the risks, she is satisfied with witnessing the truth with her eyes and documenting and reporting on it.\n\nEsther is more than a journalist. She is a lifeline for those whose cries would otherwise vanish in the dark. And no matter the risk, she will keep writing and keep reporting, because for her, silence is never an option.",

    "text": "Environmental groups initiated global activities and protests from September 18 to 21 to drumbeat the call for urgent climate action amid the worsening pollution and continuing deterioration of the natural ecosystem. The series of protests were held right before the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and less than six weeks away from the UN Climate Summit (COP30) in Brazil.\n\nIn Asia, the “Draw the Line” campaign highlighted the demand to phase out fossil fuels, build renewables, shift to sustainable food, and prioritize the people’s basic needs over corporate interests.\n\nSeveral countries participated in the campaign led by a network of environmental groups and community-based organizations.\n\nIn the Philippines, the campaign was actively supported by local groups resisting projects and policies that threaten the lives and livelihoods of rural and coastal communities. A fluvial protest was organized in the town of Culasi in Antique province, located in the Visayas islands of the Philippines, to call attention to the demand of the small fisherfolk against the entry of commercial fishing operations in municipal waters. Javie Barcinal of 350.org Asia echoed the stand of small fishers.\n\nSmall fishers are among the worst affected by the climate crisis, with warming seas resulting in dwindling catches each year. To make matters worse, the government has allowed industrial fishing to encroach into municipal waters. This exacerbates climate injustice that small fishers experience as hunger for their families.\n\nIn Indonesia, environmnetalists organized at least 36 actions in 34 cities and provinces across the country on September 18, to push for bold reforms in government policies. A march was held towards the State Palace on September 19 as rallyists reiterated the anti-corruption demands of the youth-led protests that erupted in the country last month. Sisilia Nurmala Dewi of 350.org Indonesia led climate advocates in asserting an end to corruption to fund a better future.\n\nWe draw the line as flash floods drown the innocent, while people’s voices against government failures are being silenced. Oligarchs and polluters have ruled this country for far too long, taking public money for climate action and destroying natural resources that should be preserved for future generations. We demand real, decisive action. President Prabowo must honor his promises by committing to 100 percent renewable energy in 10 years and a clear immediate plan to phase-out coal plants.\n\nPaskah Toga of Climate Rangers Bali cited the recent flooding disaster in Bali island to rally public opposition against fossil-based power plants.\n\nThe recent deadly floods in Bali is clear evidence that the climate crisis is no longer a distant threat but a reality that needs to be resolved with concrete policies. The government must stop building fossil-based power plants and phase out fossil fuels.\n\nIn Japan, protesters challenged the new leadership to phase out fossil fuels and to reverse policies that blame immigrants for the country’s social woes. Masayoshi Iyoda, 350.org Japan campaigner, summed up their demand.\n\nWe draw the line on Japan’s rising contributions to climate chaos and war. As we experience both flash floods and extreme heat, workers suffer and food prices continue to soar. Japan’s new leadership must show political will to phase out fossil fuels and shift to 100% renewables, instead of going with the far-right tide of blaming immigrants for our economic woes and backsliding on climate action.\n\nThe protest was also attended by activists who expressed solidarity with Palestinians by condemning the continuous bombings and military attacks in Gaza.\n\nIn South Korea, Jiyun Gim of the Green Environment Youth Korea urged authorities to comply with the planned emissions reduction this year.\n\nSouth Korea’s 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) will be determined in November. We are drawing the line to prevent South Korea from setting a climate goal that falls below 60% emissions reduction. This is not just about numbers—it is the survival line for future generations. The government must set ambitious, science-based, and future-oriented climate targets.\n\nIn Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh, community residents staged an action denouncing the planned revival of a coal plant. Shahrukh Karim, a youth leader in Matarbari, articulated the sentiments of the local community.\n\nWe are burning, our lands are dying, and our rivers are drying up. We draw the line on building another coal plant, when the existing one has already driven away thousands of families and turned our homes into a wasteland. This needs to stop.\n\nCommunities Draw the Line on Matarbari Coal Plant 2 Revival https://t.co/2IT1VPkF5P pic.twitter.com/9E05xBK9xV — Energy & Power (@enpbd) September 20, 2025\n\nIn an email interview with Global Voices, 350.org Asia Communications Manager Ilang-Ilang Quijano shared their initial plans on how to sustain the campaign.",

    "title": "Africa charts bold path towards green inclusive development at the second Africa Climate Summit",
    "text": "Over 6,000 delegates gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, for the second Africa Climate Summit (ACS2), held from September 8 to 10, to search for Africa-driven solutions ahead of negotiations for the United Nations 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the world's largest annual environmental conference.\n\nThe second Africa Climate Summit was organized to unite African leaders, youth, and partners in pushing for fair climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s role as a solutions hub, while preparing a common position ahead of COP30 negotiations. It was a pivotal moment for Africa to stake its claim as a leader in the global climate conversation. Leaders, activists, and young innovators came together to push for reforms in climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s youth voices. The gathering was themed around “Accelerating Global Climate Solutions: Financing for Africa’s Resilient and Green Development.” Ethiopia’s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, opened the event with a keynote that set the tone:\n\nAfrica should not be seen only as a victim of climate challenges, but as a continent of solutions and innovations that could guide the world forward.\n\nHe also proposed the “Africa Climate Innovation Compact” to produce 1,000 innovators by 2030, financed and owned by Africans.\n\nThis vision was built on the momentum of the inaugural summit in Nairobi in 2023, which, importantly, was preceded by the African Youth Climate Assembly (AYCA). By doing so, organizers ensured that the majority-youth population of Africa was not just represented but central to shaping the conversation.\n\nThe challenges Africa faces\n\nAfrica continues to wrestle with the painful legacy of historical injustice and the harsh reality of a deepening climate crisis. Despite contributing the least to global emissions, the continent feels the impacts most acutely. Climate finance remains painfully inadequate as wealthy nations have consistently fallen short of their yearly pledge, and African countries today pay back about five times more in debt servicing than they receive in climate aid.\n\nThe cost of this imbalance is causing hospitals to stretch beyond capacity as diseases like malaria and cholera spread more widely under shifting climatic conditions. Crops are failing under the weight of prolonged droughts or sudden floods, leaving farmers with empty fields and families without food. Coastal cities, from Lagos to Dar es Salaam, face rising waters that sweep away homes, businesses, and livelihoods.\n\nYet at the same time, Africa holds some of the richest renewable resources on the planet. If harnessed, its solar capacity alone could power the world many times over. Africa holds 17 percent of the world’s population but receives just 3 percent of global climate investment. Restrictive financial systems and predatory loan arrangements often force African countries back into reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nEcoVista, a youth-led ecological justice movement whose main focus is on climate justice and the environment, based in Nairobi, Kenya posted on its X account:\n\nFossil fuels are the biggest driver of the climate crisis, responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. #MakeThemPay\n\nDraw The Line pic.twitter.com/N9aUDWl8e8 — EcoVistaKe (@EcoVistaKE) September 19, 2025\n\nLayered on top of that is a painful reminder of colonial history. While Africa’s minerals powered industrial growth in the Global North, the continent was left behind with ecological damage and struggling economies. Yearly natural disasters including cyclones, floods, and expanding deserts displace millions every year, and pushed African leaders at ACS2 to adopt the Addis Ababa Declaration, a clear and urgent call for change.\n\nWith regard to the consequences facing Africa, Tangwa Abilu, a Cameroonian Climate and Environmental Activist, shared on X :\n\nThe horn of Africa is grieving because their\n\n-Their farms are no longer yielding\n\n-Advancement of desert is alarming\n\n-Our major rivers are drying\n\n-Proliferation of pest and pathogens\n\n-Development of tropical diseases.\n\n-Our crop are dieing out.\n\nClimate change is a reality. pic.twitter.com/2MQ5fZG1Zo — Tangwa Abilu.🌿🌏🌾🍀🍃.SDG's. (@AbiluTangwa) December 29, 2024\n\nIn the same context, K. Diallo, an African author, drew attention to the damage caused by floods in December 2023. He posted on his X account:\n\nflood disaster in the DR Congo is a result of global warming meeting a failed state…..The global South bears more than 95% of the costs and deaths related to climate change despite making up less than 5% of consumption-based cumulative emissions above 350ppm CO2. pic.twitter.com/vTDobNNVl5 — K.Diallo ☭ (@nyeusi_waasi) December 31, 2023\n\nDemands ahead of COP30\n\nFor African leaders, climate finance must shift from symbolic promises to meaningful reparations. They argue that financing should come as debt-free grants rather than loans that deepen dependency. Historic polluters owe this to frontline communities losing their farms to drought or their homes to rising seas. The Loss and Damage Fund, in particular, needs to prioritize these vulnerable communities with direct, rapid assistance: cash for families in sinking villages, support for starved farmlands, and investment in healthcare for climate-induced trauma. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said:\n\nToo often, Africa's story begins with what we lack: finance, technology, time. Let us instead begin with what we have: the youngest population in the world, vast solar resources, and the resilience to build a new climate economy.\n\nLeaders are also demanding stronger commitments from rich nations. During last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries from the global north pledged to pay USD300 billion in climate finance, but the amount falls far short of the USD1.3 trillion per year needed by African nations, who need it to effectively adapt and transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nACS2 came at a crucial moment when the Lake Chad Basin, which once supported millions across Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic, had shrunk by over 90 percent. With it, the livelihoods of countless families have evaporated. Africa is both the most vulnerable to climate collapse and one of the most promising centers for climate solutions. As the world heads towards COP30 in Brazil in November, Africans say they do not just want to be heard, but are demanding to be recognized as solution builders and shapers of the planet’s shared future.",

    "title": "The legacy of ‘sponge cities’ left by Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian",
    "text": "Yu Kongjian (俞孔坚), 62, the Chinese landscape architect who pioneered the concept of “sponge cities,” died in a plane crash in the Pantanal region, the largest tropical wetland in the world, in Brazil, on September 23, 2025. Three other people also died during the accident: pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, and filmmakers Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., who were both working with Yu to create a documentary about sponge cities. The cause of the crash is under investigation.\n\nFerraz’s work focused on nonfiction productions, including a series about the 2016 plane crash involving the Brazilian football team, Chapecoense. Crispim Jr. worked on projects such as a documentary about Brazilian architect Vilanova Artigas and another about the first women’s football national team in Brazil.\n\nBrazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, posted condolences on his X account and highlighted Yu's work:\n\nFoi com tristeza e consternação que recebi a notícia do desastre aéreo ocorrido no Pantanal no início da noite desta terça-feira, 23. A tragédia, infelizmente, custou as vidas do piloto Marcelo Pereira de Barros, dos documentaristas Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz e Rubens… — Lula (@LulaOficial) September 24, 2025\n\nIt was with sadness and consternation that I received the news about the aircraft disaster that happened in the Pantanal regional, early Tuesday night, the 23rd. The tragedy, unfortunately, took the lives of the pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, documentarians Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., and the Chinese architect Kongjian Yu. In times of climate change, Kongjian Yu became a world reference for sponge cities, which unite life quality and environment protection: something we want — and need — for the future. To all the victims’ friends, family and coworkers, I leave my deepest sorrows.\n\nYu’s legacy\n\nYu was in Brazil to work on a documentary, but he had also recently attended the São Paulo International Architecture Biennale, which was themed “EXTREMES — Architectures for an overheated planet.” Raquel Schenkman, the Institute of Brazilian Architects’ president, responsible for the Biennale’s organization, told G1 Yu was “someone on the frontline of transformations in big urban centers facing climate change.”\n\nOn its website, the Biennale published a note saying that, as the “creator of the theory of sponge cities, Yu Kongjian left a monumental legacy, also urgent to face climate crisis in cities,” and that his work, based on ecosystemic principles, “showed in a practical and poetic way how the landscape can be a vital infrastructure to urban resilience, integrating man to nature in a sustainable way.”\n\nSponge cities concept\n\nYu’s main legacy is designing and implementing projects based on his sponge cities theory. A professor at Peking University, his “sponge city” concept became a top national priority in China in 2013, following the massive floods in the Beijing region in 2012, which left 79 people dead and tens of thousands displaced. He also founded Turenscape, one of the main landscape architecture firms in the world, based in China.\n\nYu cautioned against overly “grey” cities that rely too much on concrete and asphalt, which disrupt natural water pathways and prevent the ground from absorbing water. While conventional water management focuses on draining water through engineered drainage infrastructure, such as pipes and water channels, sponge cities rely on techniques such as green roofs, rainwater storage and infiltration systems, sunken green spaces, permeable pavement, bioretention ponds, wetland revitalization, restoring natural waterflow pathways, and more.\n\n“Floods are not enemies,” Yu explained in an interview with WeForum. “We can make friends with floods. We can make friends with water.”\n\nYu’s approach to urban planning has been successfully implemented in dozens of cities in China, particularly after Chinese President Xi Jinping established his thoughts on ecological civilization in 2018.\n\nIn the past decade, his natural landscape approach is becoming an important tool in city planning and water management around the world.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, where recurring extreme weather events routinely cause massive floods that displace hundreds of thousands, many city planners are looking to sponge cities as a potential solution for unprecedented levels of rainfall.\n\nSo far, the concept has mostly been implemented on a small scale in individual neighborhoods, streets, or areas, meaning its flood mitigation impacts are often limited to the local level, rather than city- or nationwide.\n\nOn X, Zhongshan city's tourism promotion outlet, commemorates Yu's death by highlighting one of his landscape projects in the southern Chinese city:\n\nOn September 23 (Brazilian time), Professor Yu Kongjian from the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at #Peking University, tragically passed away in a plane crash at the age of 62. Professor Yu had won numerous world-class #design awards, including the Oberlander Prize and the John Cobb Common Good Award. Among his representative works is the #QijiangPark in #Zhongshan, #Guangdong . This #park, transformed from the site of a former shipyard, opened in 2001 and quickly gained global attention, winning several domestic and international design awards. In designing and building the park, Professor Yu and his team preserved the original industrial relics, such as shipyard machinery, docks, and other structures, and repurposed them with new functions. [original English version from @Amzhongshan]\n\nYu himself acknowledged that scaling up the pilot projects in Chinese cities was challenging. One of his sponge city projects in Zhengzhou faced backlash after a severe flood in 2021, which claimed 12 lives in the city, prompting many to express doubts about the practicality of his idea. Moreover, as China's coastal regions are highly industrialized, they demand cross-departmental collaboration, strong political will, and extensive administrative coordination to restore concrete riverbanks and seawalls to wetlands.\n\nIn an interview with Brazilian news outlet G1, Yu said that on a scale of 1 to 10, his optimism regarding the world’s chances of reversing climate change ranked 4. He also mentioned water scarcity — one of the challenges his projects aimed to address — as the primary issue humanity will face over the next 25 years.\n\nA journalist living in China, Isabela Shi, shared Yu Kongjian’s last update on a Chinese social media platform:\n\n🕯️No último vídeo que o arquiteto chinês Yu Kongjian divulgou na rede social chinesa, ele estava mostrando a viagem a Pantanal com equipa brasileira que tenta refletir sobre Planeta Esponja através de encolhimento de zonas húmidas. “Wonderful, amazing”, encantou ele pro Brasil. pic.twitter.com/fKn5ZKgIwe — Isabela Shi🇨🇳🇧🇷 (@ShiIsabela) September 25, 2025",

    "title": "How a comics school taught perseverance and creative freedom in Bosnia & Herzegovina",
    "text": "This article by Adin Kadrić first appeared in Balkan Diskurs on September 12, 2025. An edited version is being republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement with the Post-Conflict Research Center (PCRC).\n\nEditor's note: Zenica is a city in the middle of Bosnia and Herzegovina with about 100,000 residents. It is noted for its ironworks industry as well as being home to one of the big prisons in ex-Yugoslavia, described in the cult rock song Zenica Blues. It is not often considered when speaking about art, making the significance of this initiative — which began during the war of 1992-1995 and still persists to this day — even more extraordinary.\n\nFor over 30 years, the Zenica School of Comics has been not only an illustration school but a symbol of perseverance, cultural resistance, and lasting dedication to art. Initially conceived as an escape from the repression of the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and later, a platform for expression and creativity, the school has trained around 200 young artists. About 70 of them have gone on to become prominent young authors, whose works have left a mark on the domestic and regional comics scene.\n\nSeveral graduates are even acclaimed beyond the borders of their country, with Kenan Halilović, Biljana Šafaražik, and Zdravko Cvjetković being some of the most prominent. While the school has been synonymous with quality and creativity within the domestic comic scene for years, the international acclaim for these artists’ work underscores the fact that Zenica maintains a firm foothold in this visual medium.\n\nRecalling its beginnings, Adnadin Jašarević, the school’s founder and director of the Zenica City Museum, said that its primary goal was to give children a creative escape from the harsh realities of war. Under such conditions, comics were like Alice in Wonderland — providing an escape from hunger, fear, and shelling. An average of ten students still pass through the school every year, learning how to translate their thoughts, fears, and hopes into dynamic sequences of frames and speech clouds.\n\nNewer names like Filip Andronik, Milorad Vicanović, Senad Mavrić, and Enis Čišić represent the contemporary wave of comic artists from BiH. They actively cooperate with renowned publishers from the United States and Europe, demonstrating that despite its underdeveloped infrastructure, Bosnia and Herzegovina has comic creators who can stand equally alongside the best talent the genre has to offer.\n\nPublications such as “Horostop,” “ZE strip,” “EKO strip” and “SUV – Steps in Time” were created at the Zenica School, showcasing both its longevity and its dedication to comic culture. Explaining that the students themselves choose the topics they work on according to their own interests, Jašarević noted that he has “never stopped working” to ensure that comics remain a tool for expression and creative release.\n\nAs far as technology’s impact on the comic industry goes, Jašarević explained that while comics used to be widely available to the masses, they are now becoming a far more exclusive product, with expensive integral editions and albums intended for a small but loyal audience. While the idea behind ​​comics as a liberating medium remains the same, the development of technology has heralded a turn in modern-day comic production.\n\nCartoonist and former Zenica student Zdravko Cvjetković, in speaking about the impact of technology, emphasized that smart tablets have made drawing easier and faster for many artists, without compromising the quality of their work. However, he warned that AI tools — such as those used for generating text and images — pose serious ethical and aesthetic questions.\n\nHe believes that the mass availability of tools that produce images and stories in seconds, threatens to trivialize art and blur the line between creativity and automation: “If we all become artists just because we have a tool in our pocket, then nobody is really an artist.”\n\nMany things about comics today, according to Cvjetković, are drastically different than before the war: “Comics are no longer accessible to such a wide audience, especially children. They’re too expensive and rarely found in newsstands.”\n\nThe burgeoning Bosnian comics scene\n\nPointing out that children today reach for screens before print media like comics or books, Cvjetković said that publishers are therefore targeting older generations who grew up with comics.\n\nA positive outcome of this is the growing number of comics festivals in the region, which promote a culture of reading and drawing. “Workshops and comics contests for children [are] an almost mandatory part of every serious festival,” Cvjetković emphasized, “and this is crucial in the absence of comics schools like the one in Zenica.”\n\nComics culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina persists despite its modest ecosystem, in which there is almost no institutional support, and few major publishers or specialized festivals. However, thanks to the enthusiasm of individuals, the scene is not disappearing; in fact, it is quietly but steadily growing.\n\nAuthors like Berin Tuzlić and Enis Čišić have been representing BiH on the regional and international comics scene for years. Tuzlić, known for his experimental approach and multimedia projects, combines comics with music and animation. Čišić, who also tried his hand at Marvel productions, represents a more contemporary, technically precise form of expression. Their work shows that the country is producing talent capable of competing globally.\n\nIsmet Erdić also holds a special place on the BiH comics scene, with his rare combination of historical storytelling and visual narration in comics about Kulin Ban and medieval Bosnia. His work has educational value and is often used in classrooms, which makes him one of the few authors whose comics reach the general public.\n\nDespite unfavorable conditions for comic distribution, publicity, and marketing, comics culture in BiH is still preserved as a niche interest by enthusiasts. Social networks, web comics, and regional cooperation with authors from Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia are currently key to their survival. So, while relatively small, the BiH comics scene has an authentic flair and great potential, waiting for better times ahead.",

    "text": "In Togo, a national initiative built on civic solidarity helps relieve parents’ yearly back-to-school expenses.\n\nEducation is free and compulsory throughout the country, with a population of over 9.5 million. Following a two-month break (from mid-July to mid-September), more than 3 million students returned to school this month. While the authorities continue to work on improving education through teacher training and recruitment, investing in renovations and school infrastructure, the parents’ main priority is seeing their children succeed at the end of each school year.\n\nOver the years, there has been a marked increase in the gross enrollment rate and the proportion of Togolese students completing the school year. In April 2025, the local news website Lechiquier published:\n\n…le taut brut de scolarisation au primaire dépasse 100%. Il était de l’ordre de 111,70% en 2023, 116,70% en 2024 et une prévision de 116,20% pour l’année 2025. Dans le même sillage, le taux d’achèvement du primaire a évolué de 88,80% en 2023 à 94,60% en 2024. Pour l’année 2025, le gouvernement table sur une augmentation de 121,70%.\n\nThe gross primary school enrolment rate now exceeds 100 percent. In 2023, it was approximately 111.70 percent, in 2024 it was 116.70 percent, and 116.20 percent is forecast for 2025. Similarly, the primary school completion rate increased from 88.80 percent in 2023 to 94.60 percent in 2024. For 2025, the government forecasts an increase to 121.70 percent.\n\nThis rate of over 100 percent is due to it far exceeding the initial estimated value.\n\nFree school education\n\nTogo is one of five African countries with high enrollment rates in school, an impressive development stemming from the various reforms the authorities have implemented in the education sector. In 2008, Togo introduced free pre-school and primary education in the public sector. Since the beginning of the 2021–2022 school year, education in public secondary schools has also been free, a measure the authorities will maintain for the 2025–2026 school year.\n\nThese measures help combat inequities in accessing education. However, efforts, such as providing student school kits (notebooks, books, pens, pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, and school bags), are still required to tackle inequality and ensure universal coverage.\n\nTogo’s guaranteed monthly minimum wage (SMIG) increased from FCFA 35,000 (USD 64) in 2012 to FCFA 52,500 (USD 95) in early 2023. Although this measure was introduced to support the Togolese working population of over 4 million, not all are content with its implementation, condemning the country’s ongoing poor economic situation and challenging living conditions.\n\nAssociation contributions\n\nGiven the financial crisis, parents’ biggest concern is purchasing back-to-school supplies and kits. However, Togolese civil society provides solutions. Citizens, both young and old, are quick to lend their support to help parents meet these expenses.\n\nNumerous citizens, working as part of various associations, travel to the country’s villages and remote areas, assisting and supporting children, especially the most vulnerable. These efforts are a social and solidarity-based alternative to the associations committed to child protection, education, and development.\n\nOne example is Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (the Togolese Child Protection Association or LTPE). On August 29, 2025, LTPE supported 5,000 children from 12 villages of the Amou Prefecture in the Plateaux region.\n\nLe 29 août 2025, plus de 5 000 enfants de la préfecture d’Amou venus de 12 localités différentes ont reçu des kits scolaires grâce à l’initiative « Éducation pour tous : 1 élève, 1 kit, 1 choix de vie » portée par la #LTPE. pic.twitter.com/LMroVuE9oY — Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (@LTPE_ONG) August 30, 2025\n\nOn August 29, 2025, more than 5,000 children from 12 different locations in the Amou Prefecture received school kits through the #LTPE initiative ‘Education for All: One student, one kit, one life choice.’\n\nIn an interview with Togolese media outlet Plume d'Afrique, Nina Afi Kazoulé, the LTPE coordinator, explained the scope of this measure:\n\nNous voulons par cette action éviter le décrochage scolaire. Et nous savons que le décrochage scolaire peut être dû à l'incapacité financière des parents, aux grossesses en milieu scolaire, bref à tous les comportements qui ne sont pas appropriés à adopter par un apprenant.\n\nWe want to prevent school dropouts with this measure. We know that school dropouts can happen due to the parents’ lack of financial resources, pregnancies among school girls, or any inappropriate student behavior\n\nIn the village of Zooti N'titikope, Vogan, a town 45 kilometers northwest of the Togolese capital Lomé, the Togovi Bé Sourire association and Action for Peace and Good Governance (APGG) joined forces with several other associations on September 5 and 6 to support young learners. More than 300 vulnerable children received school kits, and 20 young girls will be monitored and supported in successfully reintegrating into school.\n\nLomé also has vulnerable children supported by other groups, including the Premiers Pas pour l’Enfance (First Steps for Children or 3PE) association. Its mission is to promote equal education opportunities through solidarity initiatives, such as the payment of school fees and supply provision for children. Association President Akilou Demon told media outlet Ledefenseur:\n\nNous voulons que tous les enfants aient accès à l’éducation, car l’enfant a droit à l’école. Si certains en sont privés, ce n’est pas juste. Notre ambition est de leur donner une chance égale de réussir et de contribuer demain au développement de notre patrie.\n\nAs children have the right to attend school, we want all children to have access to education. Some are deprived, and this is not fair. We aim to give them equal opportunities to succeed and one day contribute to our country’s development.\n\nAlthough the results of various reforms are visible, shortcomings remain in Togo’s education system.\n\nSchool infrastructure, such as classrooms, is substandard, especially in villages. Students study in straw huts with few school benches (supplemented in some places with bricks) and are forced to move or interrupt their lessons due to adverse weather conditions. In 2021, these circumstances led to construction plans for 30,000 classrooms equipped with wooden class benches. However, in September 2024, the government reduced its improvement projects by more than half, going from 30,000 classrooms to just 14,632.\n\nWhile civil society can offset some of the education system’s shortcomings, it’s ultimately up to the state, which declared education free and compulsory, to improve education quality and train new teachers to achieve equal opportunities for all Togolese children.",

    "title": "In Brazil, Romani people living in peripheral areas fight for recognition of their identities",
    "text": "This article, written by Artur Ferreira and Amanda Oliveira, was originally published on May 30, 2025, on the Agência Mural website. An edited version is published on Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nIn the collective imagination, the Romani people are associated with colourful clothing, parties, accessories, and an aura of mystery, embodying a wandering spirit. But beyond the stereotypes, there is a rich history of resistance and belonging that spans centuries, including in Brazil, in the outskirts of São Paulo.\n\nIn universities, public offices, doctors’ offices, or their traditional campsites, they are fighting for their rights, against prejudice, and for recognition in a country where there are still shortcomings in caring for the diversity of these communities.\n\nIn Itaim Paulista, a neighbourhood at the eastern end of the city, 250 people live in one of the main and oldest Romani campsites in the region.\n\n“Some Romanies palm read, dance, get dressed up in traditional clothing, but some are even evangelical, like myself, and they don’t all even live in camps. We are a people like any other,” the 32-year-old housewife Magda Santos says. She has been living in the camps for eight years with her husband and two children. “I am not Romani by blood, but I became one when I got married to one.”\n\nThe Romani, also known as the Roma peoples, are an ethnic group that doesn’t have a single origin. One of the more widely accepted theories is that they are of Indian origin but have travelled the world since the 11th century in a great diaspora, dispersing throughout the Balkans, Western Europe, and later to other continents.\n\nWhile she was hanging clothes on the clothesline, 29-year-old seamstress Viviane Alves Pereira made sure to find an answer when asked about the main problems her people face. The statement came without hesitation: prejudice, invisibility and the lack of access to basic rights, a common scenario in marginalized neighbourhoods.\n\nWho are the Roma people from the outskirts?\n\nThe majority of Romani who live on the outskirts of Greater São Paulo are of the Calon ethnicity, like Magda and Viviane. They are also those who suffer the most prejudice relating to maintaining their traditions and being most recognized as “gypsies” (a term now considered derogatory), because of their clothing and their nomadic lifestyle, according to sources from this report.\n\nIn Brazil, there are two other Romani ethnic groups: the Roma and the Sinti peoples. They don’t wear traditional clothing, so they mostly go unnoticed in the cities.\n\n“Many Brazilians were already cared for by doctors, nurses and Romani lawyers, and maybe they don’t even know,” states activist Nicolas Ramanush, 64, who is the president of the NGO, Romani Embassy of Brazil (Embaixada Cigana do Brasil), in Santo André in the Greater São Paulo area.\n\n“In the region, Romani people were concentrated in the neighborhood of Itaim Paulista and in the cities of Itaquaquecetuba and Itapevi, with camps near the train stations,” he says.\n\nEach ethnicity is divided into subgroups, and each one develops its own customs, habits, religions and rituals. “In my ethnic group, for example, we always wear decorated shoes with a lot of details. Some Calon women are famous for their flowery dresses and for using handkerchiefs,” says Ramanush, who belongs to the Sinti ethnicity.\n\nThis group has the fewest number of people in the country. “Today, if there are 100 families in Brazil, it is a lot,” says Ramanush. “This is because of the period of Nazism. The Sintis were almost exterminated. Among the Romani killed during the Holocaust, the majority were Sinti and Roma,” he adds.\n\nRamanush notes that many aspects of Romani culture are integrated into the Brazilian lifestyle without most people realizing it. They were among those responsible for helping Carnival to grow, especially in the northeast, creating Carnival street blocks. Certain costumes, such as “La Ursa” (The Bear) in Recife, have a Romani origin.\n\n“Instruments like the seven or six-string guitar were brought to Brazil by the Roma people. Some samba dancers spoke about how living with the Romanies inspired them musically,” Ramanush says.\n\nUnder the canvas tents\n\nNomadic and outskirt-dwelling Romani have a routine defined by difficulties surrounding education for their children and lack of healthcare, caused by the lack of a stable address. They also face São Paulo’s structural problems, such as floods, and living under canvas tents, without safety.\n\nOne of the most impactful natural disasters was the flooding in February 2025 in the far east of São Paulo, in the region known as Jardim Pantanal. The streets and houses remained underwater for several days. The Romani in these camps had to face that situation under the tents.\n\n“We spent days underwater, and it was the neighbors from the region who helped us,” Santos remembers with outrage.\n\nThe camp’s inhabitants had to deal with a lack of drinking water; tents were affected, and according to local accounts, they had to make a joint effort to avoid major losses of furniture and appliances while the flooding advanced.\n\nJust like Santos, Ramanush believes that the first step to improving the Romani community’s life in the outskirts of Brazil is for them not to be invisible.\n\nPrejudice and invisibility\n\nEven with initiatives such as the National Day of Roma Peoples, commemorated every May 24 since 2006, some rights are still neglected. For example, Romani people are not recognized in the national census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).\n\nSantos remembers the difficulty she faced in registering her children’s ethnic group in their identity documents. Since there is no official recognition of “Romani” ethnicity, she ended up registering them by their skin color.\n\n“There are policies catered to Indigenous peoples, Black and Brown people, but not for Romani people. We have our own culture, but we do not show up, which is why I say being Romani is being invisible,” she claims.\n\nRamanush experienced a similar situation when a census taker visited him during the most recent census in Brazil in 2022. “She asked me what my race was, and I answered that it was not on the list. My complexion is white, but I’m a Romani.”\n\nIBGE estimates that Brazil has between 800,000 and a million Romani, but the Roma groups believe the numbers are higher.\n\n“I've already travelled all over Brazil meeting Romani people from all ethnic groups. Without official data, there are no efficient public policies,” Ramanush explains. “Even to count how many Romani there are in each city or town, local governments make the process difficult.”\n\nBesides the lack of recognition, Romani people living in peripheral areas also face a prejudice that runs through generations. They have been accused of theft, robbery, and deception for centuries. It wasn’t rare to have them associated with kidnapping children.\n\nTrying to change this reality and fight prejudice, Romani groups have been mobilized for the approval of a bill making teaching Romani culture and history in schools mandatory — modeling what already happens with Black and Indigenous people in Brazil. The proposal presented by federal deputy Helder Salomão (PT, Workers’ Party), at the Chamber of Deputies as Bill 3547 of 2015, has made little progress.\n\nIn their justification, the text reinforces the idea that for centuries Romani groups have been experiencing prejudice, marginalization, exclusion and persecution. So, the bill aims to “change the image of Romani populations, trying to reduce prejudice and discrimination that these groups are subjected to.”\n\nThe bill also asserts that providing visibility for Romani groups “will provide a more fertile ground to build public policies focusing on the promotion of human rights.”",

    "title": "Cambodian and Thai activists unite to end hostility and promote peace over border disputes",
    "text": "This article was published by Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand. An edited version has been republished by Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement.\n\nBetween July and May 2025, tensions between Thailand and Cambodia over a border dispute devolved into violence that left at least 43 dead on both sides, dozens injured, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Despite signing a ceasefire agreement on July 28, hostility has remained deeply embedded in both countries, fueled by misinformation. Amidst the turmoil, Cambodians and Thais have come together to launch a cross-border campaign aimed at combating hatred and promoting empathy and lasting peace.\n\nThailand and Cambodia share over 700 kilometres of border, where several undemarcated sections have been long-standing sources of conflict between the two countries, since the Preah Vihear dispute beginning in the 1950s, to this year when clashes broke out on May 28th and led to fatalities on July 24th. On top of that, the countries also share historical and cultural ties, which have complicated the tensions between them, leading to deep-rooted hostility between the two peoples.\n\nHostility skyrocketed after the July 24 armed conflict as the conflict between the two governments trickled down to all facets of society. Cambodian and Thai netizens traded accusations on who initiated the clashes.\n\n“We see all the problems start to unfold, and when hatreds, prejudice, and discrimination on people’s level have gone online, it was even more devastating for us, and that's why we decided to come together on the Cambodian side to rally among ourselves,” said Lim Solinn, a Cambodian social activist and artist. She later reached out to friends in Thailand in different places and then stumbled upon a group of Thai people who are a network of solidarity.\n\nOu Tepphallin, a Cambodian labor rights activist and campaign co-organizer, said she joined the campaign to address the suffering of migrant workers and communities caught in the crossfire of recent tensions, particularly Cambodian workers in Thailand and Thai workers in Cambodia.\n\nThey faced physical violence and racism, and they were living with fear, so their voices were unheard. On top of that, children living along the border have lost opportunities to study due to the closure of border crossings. Family members were separated, such as a child whose mother was in Thailand but whose father was in Phnom Penh, and they have no idea when they can be reunited.\n\nIn addition, according to the Thai authorities, the conflict since July 24th has also caused over 500,000 Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand to return home, since most of them felt unsafe and threatened in Thailand. This has left Thailand with a significant labor shortage as Cambodian migrants typically played an essential role in the country's agricultural industry.\n\nSolinn stated that both Thai and Cambodian campaign organizers want the campaign to go viral in both countries and send messages to leaders saying, “Please don't use violence on Cambodian or Thai migrant workers.”\n\nThe campaigners are also trying to figure out catchy ways for this campaign to go viral and reach regular Thais and Cambodians. The campaign includes writing poems and making songs, which they believe could help calm people and encourage them not to hate simply because of what they heard or saw on the news.\n\n“We’re just starting, even if the war ends tomorrow, the hatred continues, so we need to continue this work and reach out to more communities in Cambodia and in Thailand,” said Solinn.\n\nPhallin added that it's time to heal those who suffered from both sides, and that is what the campaign did by starting to send healing messages to ordinary people.\n\nWhen hatred is louder than empathy\n\nIn Thailand, when the armed conflict erupted and innocent Thai civilians and military personnel were killed, many Thai netizens demanded tit for tat retaliation. In addition, right-wing influencers have threatened Cambodian migrant workers and called on patriots to use violence against them.\n\nOften, those who oppose this and call for a peaceful approach face condemnation online for being too optimistic or unpatriotic.\n\n“All the ordinary Cambodians want nothing but peace and harmony with our neighbours, and a lot of people get caught in between these polarizations, and because of the level of their vulnerability, they cannot get their voices heard at all,” noted Solinn.\n\nOn the Cambodian side, Solinn remarked that while they wanted peace and for this war to stop, most Cambodians also became enraged and emotional when they saw news about civilians being affected, schools being bombed, or news that many people were displaced.\n\nShe disclosed that since she and her friends launched the campaign, she has been harassed by netizens from both countries. For her, it has been difficult to get through to people how the hyper-nationalistic, violent narratives are spreading hate. Solinn said:\n\nThey have been misinformed and disinformed. They believe these sets of stories, and they have these perspectives, and it's hard to change. So, instead of trying to tell them a different version, we’re trying to appeal to their consciousness. We try to appeal to their empathy.\n\nEven though most of the information they received was not real, it was effective as it was coupled with prejudice, stereotyping, and hate speech amplified by social media. “It has added fuel to the fire of ultra nationalist perspectives. It just made it really hard for people to try to bridge across for people who are like us,” said Solinn.\n\nShe insisted that engaging with the same outrage and accusing each other of doing what each side thinks is wrong will not improve the situation, particularly for disputes that have been going on for hundreds of years, based on selective history from both sides.\n\nSolinn emphasized that it was time to put people’s lives first. Children should be able to return to school instead of living in refugee camps, families should be able to earn their livelihoods again, and both countries need to recognize the damage the conflict has inflicted on their economies.\n\nA call for peace: rebuilding trust and fostering empathy\n\n“We would like to urge the leaders to sit down and find a peaceful resolution and put the people first,” said Phallin. She also urged the leaders to negotiate and rebuild trust, insisting that peace can be achieved only by negotiation, not war.\n\nIn the meantime, Solinn urged the leaders to be compassionate and gentle and to reach a peaceful resolution, adding that a tremendous amount of strength is required. The campaign organizer also called on leaders on both sides to stop this war and allow everything to return to normal for the sake of the innocent people from both countries.\n\nShe suggested that Thailand and Cambodia stop promoting biases and stereotypes based on selective interpretations of history, particularly for the younger generations.\n\nSolinn also believes that when this war ends, Thais and Cambodians will come together to create mixed communities where people from both sides could share safe spaces and raise awareness of peace and harmony.\n\n“Educating in school or through the media wouldn't be enough. We need all the spaces, all the communities, we need a whole society to heal and to promote racial tolerance, peace, solidarity, and harmony,” said Phallin.\n\nIn terms of media, Solinn said media, particularly mainstream media, in both countries should not amplify hateful rhetoric, which has already been dominant on social media, but rather people’s stories, which would help promote reconciliation and peace, suggesting that selective parts of the history on both sides shouldn’t be allowed to frame the whole narrative about Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nShe noted that we did not know everything, but only heard different sides of the story. Each side believed the other started the war first or believed that the other side encroached upon their land.\n\n“Trust is so fragile. It's so easy to break, and it's broken already. It's very hard to rebuild, but we must try. We do not have a choice,” noted Solinn.",

    "title": "The judiciary’s dilemma: Protecting Nigeria’s whistleblowers without legislation",
    "text": "Nigeria’s whistleblower policy, introduced on December 21, 2016, was designed as a quick fix to expose systemic corruption. It promised whistleblowers between 2.5 and 5 percent of recovered looted public funds. However, while the policy incentivizes disclosures, it does not guarantee protection.\n\nInstead, whistleblowers often face surveillance, dismissal, or even death threats. Multiple attempts to pass a whistleblower protection bill over the years have stalled in Nigeria’s National Assembly, leaving whistleblowers legally vulnerable.\n\nNigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework\n\nOn September 18, 2025, Federal High Court judges and civil society advocates debated on Nigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework at a national interactive forum convened by the African Centre for Media & Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) for federal high court judges, in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city.\n\nHarry Ogwuche, the Director of Economic and Social Rights at Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), shared during the debate:\n\nProtecting whistleblowers is not an abstract anti-corruption strategy; it is a direct, proactive investment in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights as enshrined in Chapter IV of our Constitution and various international covenants Nigeria is party to.\n\nThe role of judges in protecting whistleblowers\n\nWhile seeking the support of judges in the advocacy for a whistleblower protection law in Nigeria, Chido Onumah, Coordinator of AFRICMIL, said:\n\nJudges are key actors in any judicial system. Therefore, the forum aims to provide a platform for interaction with judges on whistleblowing, its legal framework, and the critical role they play in ensuring justice for whistleblowers and handling corruption cases effectively.\n\nAt the forum, persecuted whistleblower Yisa Usman shared how he was pressured, intimidated, and sidelined from his profession after blowing the whistle on his company. Usman is a chartered accountant who worked in the finance and accounts department, but after exposing corruption, he was redeployed to the ICT department, transferred to different states, and subsequently fired. He said:\n\nBecause I decided to speak up, I am jobless. I was ostracized and frustrated to accept the norm. To remain silent is to be complicit. To achieve results as a whistleblower, it is important to be familiar with the laws because if you know the laws that guide and protect you, you will be able to challenge them. Despite several attempts to detain me, I am walking free because of the judiciary.\n\nExisting and pending laws to protect whistleblowers\n\nNigeria’s Constitution and several statutes already contain protections that could be extended to whistleblowers. These include: Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. Section 6(4)(c) of the National Human Rights Commission Act prohibits harassment of individuals who cooperate with the Commission. Anti-corruption laws like the EFCC Act and ICPC Act provide limited safeguards. The Freedom of Information Act protects disclosures made in good faith.\n\nIn practice, these fragmented provisions are inconsistently applied, and without a unified protection law, whistleblowers continue to face retaliation.\n\nNigeria’s situation contrasts sharply with that of its regional neighbors. Ghana’s Whistleblower Act (Act 720) and South Africa’s Protected Disclosures Act provide dedicated mechanisms.\n\nVladimir Radomirović, a Serbian journalist and co-founder of Pištaljka, an organization based in Belgrade that provides free legal aid and protection to whistleblowers, shared his experiences of building alliances with the judiciary to strengthen whistleblower protection in Serbia. He said:\n\nThe judges have a very influential role in protecting whistleblowers in Serbia, and we try to work with judges and allow them to hear from whistleblowers about how they are retaliated against for protecting the public interest.\n\nAFRICMIL and its partners urged the Nigerian legislature to urgently enact the whistleblower protection law, one that guarantees anonymity, provides penalties against retaliation, and establishes an independent body to oversee cases.\n\nWhistleblowers and civil society organizations appealed to judges to embrace a proactive role in safeguarding whistleblowers. They called for progressive adjudication that interprets existing laws in the spirit of transparency and protection for defenders; expedited hearings to ensure justice is not delayed and therefore denied; the awarding of exemplary damages against retaliators to serve as a deterrent; and above all, the protection of anonymity in court procedures. These recommendations, they argued, are vital if the judiciary is to strengthen trust, uphold justice, and ensure that whistleblowing truly serves as a tool for accountability in Nigeria.",

    "title": "Nepal’s Khoj Samachar challenges corruption and empowers youth through digital media",
    "text": "There are nearly 4,900 registered print media outlets in Nepal. Around eighteen news outlets operate exclusively online through digital platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. By law, online media must register with Nepal’s Department of Information and Broadcasting; however, not all outlets currently comply with this requirement.\n\nStanding out among these registered outlets is Khoj Samachar, an independent digital media platform that raises awareness among young people, challenges corruption, and amplifies underrepresented voices in Nepal. Its founder, Roshan Shrestha, is an investigative journalist from Nepal. His approach relies on digital platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and a dedicated app to draw public attention to marginalized stories and pressure authorities to take action. The platform publishes content in Nepali, in both text and video formats.\n\nAbdulrosheed Fadipe of Global Voices interviewed Roshan via WhatsApp to discuss his journey as an investigative journalist and how he uses digital platforms to promote social change, strengthen good governance, and encourage citizen engagement in Nepal.\n\nGlobal Voices (GV): What inspired you to start Khoj Samachar, and what challenges did you face in building it from scratch?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): I started my journalism journey during my school years at Shree Bachchhala Devi Higher Secondary School, Nagpuje, Sindhupalchok District, in Bagmati Province of Nepal. When I was in class 8, a man who was the presenter at Avenues Television came to my school to teach students about journalism. That training programme planted the seed of journalism in my mind.\n\nMy interest in journalism grew after a devastating earthquake occurred in Nepal in 2015. Although the epicenter of the earthquake was located in Gorkha district, many houses in my village, which is located near the Bhotekoshi River, were destroyed. Many people lost their lives. The Tataponi border crossing with China was also closed. I had just completed class 11 then. I was using a simple Android phone because I was from a low-middle-class family that depended on agriculture for a living. With that phone, I started filming and uploading videos of the earthquake's destruction of villages on a YouTube channel. This was how my journalism career began.\n\nIn 2021, I officially launched Khoj Samachar. I did not receive any financial support when I started nor did I have a big team. Now we have a team of four individuals broadcasting news in both English and Nepali.\n\nGV: How do you maintain editorial independence and ensure your outlet's content remains unbiased and free from external influences?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): We do not take money, favors, or support from any political party, business group, or outside donor. From day one, Khoj Samachar has survived only through the income we earn from Facebook and YouTube ads. With those limited earnings, we pay our team and run the entire platform. This is not always easy, but it gives us full freedom. Nobody can tell us what to say or what to hide. We can question leaders, expose corruption, and speak for the people without fear of losing sponsors or upsetting funders. Our only loyalty is to our readers and viewers. For us, independence is more valuable than comfort. Even if the road is difficult, we choose truth over compromise — that is why our content remains unbiased and trusted.\n\nGV: How do you prioritize stories that amplify underrepresented media voices, and what impact do you hope these stories have on your audience?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): At Khoj Samachar, we always give priority to the voices that big media often ignores — farmers, workers, rural youth, and ordinary citizens who face injustice. Many times, people from villages directly contact us to share their pain, because they feel unheard elsewhere.\n\nWe have highlighted stories like that of a person struggling to get a bridge built in his village, a road left unfinished for 10 years, or a family trapped in hardship without support. By showing these issues through videos, we try to bring public attention and pressure the authorities to act.\n\nOur hope is that by giving a platform to these underrepresented voices, young people will feel more connected, more aware, and inspired to raise their own voices. We want our audience to see that journalism is not only about leaders and cities, but also about the real struggles of common people — and that truth can bring real change.\n\nGV: What strategies do you use to reach audiences beyond capital cities, and how do you measure the impact of your reporting in these areas?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): From the beginning, our focus was not only on Kathmandu but also on rural and remote areas. We create stories that reflect the real problems of villages — like missing bridges in Humla, neglected roads in Dailekh, or migrant workers’ struggles. Many of these issues are sent to us directly by local people through phone calls, Facebook messages, or our app. By turning their voices into reports and videos, we make sure their problems are heard nationally.\n\nTo measure impact, we look at the response from citizens and authorities. For example, in Saudi Arabia, when stranded workers contacted us, our coverage led to parliamentary debates and direct government action. Similarly, when we cover local problems, we monitor community feedback in comments, shares, and messages, and also check if the government or local representatives respond. For us, the real impact is when ordinary people feel their voices are finally heard and some positive change begins.\n\nGV: What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced as an independent journalist, and how have you overcome them?\n\nRS: There have been many difficult moments in my journey, but the most painful ones came when some people, who are unable to accept the truth, started abusing my family and even threatened physical attacks in public. As a journalist, I can tolerate criticism and risk, but when my family is dragged into controversy for my work, it is truly unbearable.\n\nSpeaking the truth, especially against corruption and powerful figures, always brings political pressure. Many tried to silence us or scare us into stopping, but journalism loses its meaning if we compromise with fear. What keeps me going is the trust and support of the public and the inner courage to always speak the truth. The emotional burden is heavy, but I continue because ordinary people rely on us to be their voice, and that responsibility gives me the strength to move forward.\n\nGV: How do you envision the future of Khoj Samachar, and what steps are you taking to ensure its sustainability and continued impact?\n\nRS: My main goal is to build Khoj Samachar as a platform based only on truth and facts, not dependent on external funding or political power. The message I want to pass to youth is that they can succeed in journalism by standing for the truth, even if they are alone. I am working to add more features to the Roshan Shrestha App so that it will be useful for the public. This step will help us sustain our work, expand our impact, and keep serving society with independent journalism.\n\nGV: Why did you name the Roshan Shrestha App after yourself?\n\nRS: By putting my own name on the app, I wanted to assure users that this platform is genuine, transparent, and trustworthy. It is not for self-promotion but rather a matter of responsibility: if my name is attached, people know they can rely on it.",

But sharp cuts to foreign aid by a number of governments are shrinking the available funds for nonprofits, with digital rights organizations like ours taking a particular hit.\n\nAnd it’s a hard time for news and translation organizations right now, with new technologies being used to cut staff and mass-produced disinformation crowding out quality news. Even in this challenging time, Global Voices’ production and readership have been going up, but since we are committed to never paywalling and not showing ads, that doesn’t translate into covering our running costs unless readers donate.\n\nGlobal Voices is a relatively low-cost organization to run: we have no office, no rent, and few physical supplies. We pay for the servers that host our site and a few other administrative costs, but by far the majority of our expenses are for paying our staff. Many grants don’t want to fund more than a small percentage of personnel costs, because they want to pay directly for activities, but personnel costs are the basis of all our activities. Our staff and our volunteers research stories, write and edit, translate and advocate — and sometimes they also do graphic design or photo choice, social media promotion, and more. That is who we’re trying to support with the funds from this campaign — our community, the people who make the articles and essays, translations, research reports, and podcasts that you find on our site.\n\nIf we had a dollar for every page view of the site, we wouldn't need to do a campaign! And if each of those dollars were a monthly commitment, we’d be able to plan ahead for longer-term activities and be generally less stressed. But we know that not everyone can contribute for lots of different reasons, so instead we can think about it as five dollars from one-fifth of the monthly site visits, or ten dollars from one-tenth, and maybe someone who hasn't read anything this month but believes in what we do kicks in twenty-five bucks, and someone else who loves translations sends another fifteen and… you get the idea.\n\nWe hope that you can be one of those contributors, and if you can’t right now, we hope you still come and spend time on our site, and then tell other people about it. Even more than a news site, Global Voices is a community, and we’d like you to be a part of it.

    "title": "The paradox of women’s rights in Peru",
    "text": "By Grecia Flores Hinostroza\n\nIn Peru, women’s rights exist in a strange paradox: on paper, we have the laws, the representation, and the international commitments that promise equality; in reality, our lives tell a different story. Political progress coexists alongside persistent neglect, with numbers that flatter and figures that fail. This contradiction is not hidden in the shadows — the painful contrast is written plainly in the numbers we so proudly display.\n\nAccording to the SDG Gender Index, Peru scores 72.9 for “Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments,” a figure that suggests progress, visibility, and leadership. And yet, when we shift our gaze to health, the score drastically drops to 35.5, barely half. Women are present in Congress, but absent from the healthcare system that should protect them.\n\nIf political participation alone were enough, our streets would be safer, our hospitals accessible, and our voices heard beyond the voting booth. But in Peru, as in much of Latin America, representation has not broken the chains of inequality — it has simply made them less visible to those who govern.\n\nThe data tells one story. The lives of rural, Indigenous, and poor women tell another — one where access to basic sexual and reproductive health services is a distant reality. Where hospitals, experts, and care are unreachable. As the political scientist Stéphanie Rousseau notes in “The Politics of Reproductive Health in Peru,” “Although health sector reforms have had some positive impact on women’s reproductive health, the many restrictions placed on women’s right to reproductive choices have blocked further progress.”\n\nThe consequences are not abstract. In 2020, Peru’s maternal mortality ratio stood at 69 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the World Health Organization, far above the Latin American average of 45 and nearly five times that of Chile (16) and Uruguay (13). These numbers represent women whose lives could have been saved by timely care, safe births and the fulfilment of rights already recognized by law.\n\nBut these injustices are not only moral failures; they are legal betrayals. Peru has signed its name beneath international promises: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and others. These are not distant treaties gathering dust in diplomatic archives. They are binding commitments, written to safeguard the dignity, health, and safety of women — commitments meant to reach every hospital room, courtroom, and remote village in our country.\n\nLaws protecting sexual and reproductive health rights exist on paper, but they remain distant from the realities of rural, Indigenous, and poor women. Clinics lack essential services. Comprehensive reproductive care is unavailable. Legal frameworks declare equality, but equality disappears in places where women still face forced pregnancies, unsafe births, and systemic neglect.\n\nThe Constitution speaks of equality, but equality does not walk the roads where women carry their pregnancies alone. The Ministry of Health issues protocols, but those protocols do not save lives when the nearest health centre is closed, or when the only doctor is gone. Rights without access are hollow. Commitments without implementation are betrayal.\n\nIn this context, political representation must not be mistaken for liberation. We cannot accept the illusion of progress that comes from more women in office if it is not matched by concrete action to dismantle structural barriers. Empowerment is not an empty slogan — it is the lived reality without fear, accessing healthcare without barriers, and raising one’s voice without retaliation.\n\nThe gap between law and life is not an abstract policy flaw; it is a daily crisis. It is the young girl in a rural province forced to give birth after sexual assault because abortion is inaccessible. It is the mother who dies on the way to a hospital that never has the capacity to treat her. Likewise, it is the Indigenous community where reproductive rights exist only in the language of faraway courts, not in the practice of local healthy systems.\n\nIf we measure success only by the presence of women in power, we ignore the absence of justice in their communities. Numbers in parliament cannot compensate for empty maternity wards. International recognition cannot replace the right to safe childbirth.\n\nI call on the Peruvian Congress to legislate not for appearances, but for autonomy. To ensure that health, safety, and dignity are realities in every province. I call on international donors to fund the fight for reproductive freedom, not just political participation. And I call on Peruvian society to recognize that representation without rights is no victory at all.\n\nRepresentation matters. But it is only the beginning. Real empowerment is when every woman controls her future — her body, her health, her voice — regardless of where she was born or how far she lives from the capital. Until the day, the paradox will remain, and progress will be a promise half-kept.",

    "title": "Pro-government campaign against student protests attempts to justify repression in Serbia",
    "text": "This analysis by Nataša Stanojević was originally published by the International and Security Affairs Centre (ISAC), part of the regional initiative Western Balkans Anti-Disinformation Hub. An edited version is republished by Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nThe protest held on June 28 this year in Belgrade, on the Serbian national and religious holiday, Vidovdan, represented the culmination of months of public discontent with government policies and systemic societal problems.\n\nVidovdan is deeply rooted in national history and collective memory and has often been used as a symbol of political and moral struggle. In this case, students and other citizens chose the date to underscore the seriousness of their demands for responsible governance, to call for snap elections, and advocate for essential institutional reforms.\n\nAccording to estimates, the protest gathered around 140,000 people, making it one of the largest political gatherings in the past decade. The sheer size of the turnout reflects profound social frustration and a sense that institutional mechanisms for expressing discontent have completely failed. However, while the organizers’ demands were clearly defined — fighting corruption, institutional accountability, and democratization of the system — pro-government media constructed an entirely different picture.\n\nInstead of fact-based reporting, the public sphere was flooded with sensationalist headlines and claims aimed at delegitimizing the protests and criminalizing participants. The student movement and citizens were not portrayed as advocates of democratic values, but as a threat to the stability of the state. This strategy of criminalization, typical of authoritarian regimes, allowed the authorities to justify the use of force and intensified repression.\n\nPro-government media in Serbia systematically employ false and manipulative narratives to discredit legitimate civic protests and normalize the state’s repressive responses. Analysis shows that key propaganda tactics include labeling participants, manipulating events, constructing an image of a foreign enemy, and glorifying police force. These practices have long-term consequences for democratic processes and freedom of expression.\n\nInstruments of the propaganda narrative\n\nOne of the most commonly used strategies was the deployment of pejorative labels. Organizers and participants were not referred to as students or citizens but as “blockaders,” “hooligans,” and “terrorists.”\n\nA headline in the tabloid newspaper Informer, “Anti-hooligan operation in the city center: Watch how blockaders are arrested,” illustrates how police intervention was presented as necessary and legitimate, while citizens were criminalized. The term “terrorists” carries particularly strong connotations, suggesting extremism, even though the protests were peaceful in nature.\n\nMedia outlets widely circulated narratives about an alleged “hellish plan” by demonstrators. Headlines such as “Bridges and the entire city under siege: The new hellish plan of blockader terrorists, they want blood and dead bodies on the streets!” create an atmosphere of fear and suggest inevitable escalation into violence. These unfounded claims serve to mobilize the government’s loyal voter base and legitimize repressive measures. Rhetoric about “blood on the streets” and “danger to citizens” not only criminalizes protest participants but also frames them as a national security threat.\n\nPro-government discourse attributed goals to the protesters, such as “destroying the state” and “overthrowing the president.” These claims are not based on any documents or public statements by organizers, whose demands focused on improving safety, fighting corruption, and ensuring political accountability. Introducing accusations of “treason” and “collaboration with enemies” is part of a broader model of political propaganda in which social resistance is portrayed as a conspiracy against national interests.\n\nWhile pro-government media insisted on an image of violent demonstrations, actual events tell a different story. According to reports from independent media and human rights organizations, the majority of the protest was peaceful. This was also confirmed by the Council of Europe.\n\nThe few incidents that occurred happened only after police intervention, during which excessive force was used. The arrests or detentions of hundreds of people, along with documented cases of physical abuse, clearly show that state repression was the dominant dynamic. This gap between the media narrative and empirical facts is a classic example of the framing technique — selective presentation of reality to shape public opinion.\n\nThe broader political context and the foreign enemy narrative\n\nParticularly concerning is the strategy of linking the protests to alleged foreign enemies, in this case, Croatia. Certain tabloids and politicians suggested that the organizers of the protests were instruments in the hands of Croatian intelligence structures and that their goal was the destabilization of Serbia. These claims have no factual basis, but serve a clear propaganda purpose: to evoke historical tensions and use national stereotypes to create a sense of threat among citizens. (The hostilities between Serbia and Croatia have deep roots in their national narratives. These tensions began during the Ottoman Empire when many Serbian refugees were settled in Croatia by the Austrian authorities. The animosity intensified during World War II when Croatia joined the Axis powers, and was solidified during the wars that accompanied Yugoslavia’s breakup. This period culminated in Operation Storm, which resulted in the majority of Serbs fleeing Croatia.)\n\nThe use of Croatia in this narrative has a dual function: first, to mobilize patriotic sentiment; by suggesting that the protests are connected to a “hostile state,” the government reinforces its image as the defender of national interests. Second, it discredits the opposition and civic initiatives; by attributing “foreign influence” to the protests, the government delegitimizes their goals and diverts attention from internal problems such as corruption and institutional breakdown. This rhetoric relies on the well-known model of “constructing a foreign enemy,” which, according to political communication theory, serves to homogenize the electorate and justify authoritarian practices.\n\nA particularly alarming segment of the propaganda campaign concerns the linkage of protests with the issue of Srebrenica. (The 1995 massacre of the Muslim population in Srebrenica and its surrounding areas by the Army of Republika Srpska is frequently exploited by both nationalist and anti-Western factions in Serbia. Similar to narratives that deny the Holocaust, discussions about Srebrenica range from complete denial to unsettling debates about the number of victims, their nationality, and the use of terms like “necessary military action” and “collateral damage.” Over the past 15 years, anyone who does not support these narratives has been labeled a “traitor” or a “Western agent” in official political discourse.)\n\nIn an Informer article entitled “They’ve exposed themselves! This is blockader politics: Accusing Serbia of a nonexistent genocide in Srebrenica,” students were accused of “agreeing with accusations that brand Serbs as a genocidal nation.” This narrative attempts to shift the focus from demands for democratization to a national question, creating the impression that the protests have an “anti-Serbian agenda.” In this way, civic resistance is criminalized through manipulation of one of the most emotionally charged issues in the public sphere.\n\nA similar rhetoric is used by the portal Vaseljenska in the article “Blockaders want to declare Serbs a genocidal nation: Elections, then a government that will recognize the genocide in Srebrenica.” These claims are absent from any official demands of the organizers, but their function is clear: to discredit the protests by linking them with alleged plans to “betray national interests.” Thus, the government constructs a narrative in which students are not only “hooligans” but also agents of dangerous ideological and political projects.\n\nNarrative vs objective facts\n\nIn the long term, such practices lead to the consolidation of authoritarian patterns of governance. When every criticism of regime representatives is labeled as “treason” or “terrorism,” the space for democratic dialogue disappears. This not only delegitimizes protests but also undermines the fundamental values on which modern democratic societies rest.\n\nThis analysis of the media narrative surrounding the Vidovdan protests demonstrates that pro-government media act as a propaganda apparatus whose primary function is the preservation of political power, not informing the public. Through the dissemination of a distorted perception of civic resistance, the construction of violent scenarios, and the invention of foreign enemies, the authorities succeed in delegitimizing valid social demands and justifying repressive measures. Such a strategy may stabilize the regime in the short term, but in the long run, it erodes the foundations of democracy and leads to further political and social crises.",

    "title": "‘It is hard to feel neutral’: How Nepal's media covered the Gen Z uprising",
    "text": "This Dart Centre Asia Pacific Report by Arun Karki was originally published in Nepali Times, and an edited version has been republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.\n\nWhat should a journalist do when young protesters are shot in front of her? Does she do her job and stay neutral? Can you stay neutral?\n\nAs Gen Z protests engulfed Kathmandu, Nepal's journalists found themselves reporting a story that was personal. While doing their job, some of them were even targeted by mobs.\n\nRead More: Gen Z stands up to expose corruption in Nepal\n\nDart Asia Pacific Fellow Arun Karki visited their newsrooms and spoke with his colleagues about their experience of reporting the Gen Z protests that erupted on September 8th. These are the first-hand accounts of journalists who witnessed the turmoil in the city they call home.\n\nSunita Karki was at a workshop in a hotel on September 8th. She saw the first waves of protests through hotel windows. Curfew alerts flooded her phone, a vehicle belonging to a human rights group sat burning across the road, young boys were taking their wounded friends on motorbikes to local hospitals, and police were beating a teenager with their hands raised.\n\n“I cried a lot,” she said, but the tears were not out of fear — they were because she felt guilt. “I couldn’t write the news. We were witnessing these scenes from a five-star hotel.” By evening, the death toll had reached 19. On September 9th at about 3:35 pm, her outlet, the Annapurna Post's office in Tinkune, Kathmandu, was set on fire. Staff had to leave the building as parts of the newsroom burned down.\n\nWhen she knew her office was burning, she anxiously told her husband that she would resign from the job: “If we have to hide our identification cards in every protest, what kind of journalist am I?” she asked herself.\n\nShe filed a story the next day, but her emotions kept bouncing between those of a journalist bound to duty and a civilian in shock. She said that in moments like this, it’s hard to feel truly neutral.\n\nAfter watching the police beat people, she felt a strong urge to step in, not just stand back and report. The first real calm came later, when people came to the street and lit candles together in honor of those who were killed. “This was a sort of victory procession. I felt some relief after brutal days,” she said.\n\nAngad Dhakal a photojournalist who works at Kantipur National Daily, was standing outside his office building when protesters stormed in and set parts of it on fire. He had already been informed that protesters were planning to torch his office building and rushed to his office hoping to save his hard drives containing ten years of photography work. He failed.\n\nHe raised his camera and “forcefully” pressed the shutter — more to document the scene than out of “professional enthusiasm or duty.”\n\n“My office was burning. What should I photograph?” he recalled. A few moments later, a protester noticed the “PHOTO” label on his yellow Press jacket. Dhakal deflected it by saying he was an early-career freelancer and YouTuber. He went into a corner and took his jacket off so that protesters wouldn't target him.\n\nWhen it comes to covering street protests, Angad usually stands near the police because it feels safer. But on September 8th, fire and gunshots made even that area unsafe. A rubber bullet hit his friend Dipendra Dhungana, badly injuring him.\n\nHe thought, “Where do we go now? If we stay here, we’ll be hit.” After witnessing two days of protests, violence, and killings, and seeing his own office burning, he couldn't sleep for days.\n\nThe same afternoon that government buildings burned and media outlet Kantipur was attacked, a message in a protest Discord forum talked openly of “attacking Kantipur.”\n\nRumors spread to other outlets. Outside OnlineKhabar's office, where Gaurav Pokharel works, the newsroom manager said, “Very suspicious people were walking around.” They lowered blinds, avoided windows, locked the front gate, and dispersed staff to other places across the city. The outlet was threatened and effectively locked down, but not torched.\n\nPokharel hid his press ID. “ I never showed the ID card. Sometimes I had to enter the crowd shouting slogans, just to blend in among the protesters,” he said. He watched people fall under gunfire, and he helped pull one surrounded journalist out of a hostile crowd.\n\nGaurav also contributed articles to international outlets as a freelancer. Later, while transcribing an interview of a young protest organizer, he wrote to his editor at an international outlet: “This was very hard to write. I cried many times while doing it.” He had been working at a stretch for days, battling bouts of exhaustion and low blood pressure.\n\nProtesters vandalized and set fire within the Singha Darbar complex housing Nepal Television and Radio Nepal. They tried to disrupt public broadcasting.\n\nSurendra Paudyal began the day with his press ID hanging on his neck, thinking it would let him move freely. But when he reached Singha Darbar around 3:30 pm, the situation felt dangerous.\n\nHe put the ID in his pocket. When asked what mattered most, he answered without pause: life comes first. In that moment, he felt real fear and a strong duty to protect his team.\n\nHis focus narrowed to basic things: stay calm, find exits, get everyone out safely. Later, they were able to keep the 8 pm news on air through a regional link. He felt mixed emotions and a sense of relief that the broadcast continued, but also sadness and anger that their own studio had come under attack.",

    "title": "The great silence surrounding marital rape in Senegal",
    "text": "By Bowel Diop\n\nGender-based violence, including marital rape, occurs worldwide, and often, the perpetrators are the victim's husband. Marital rape is defined as an act in which one partner forces the other to engage in non-consensual sex. A report by Equality, a US-based organisation with offices in New York, Nairobi, and London, reveals that many women are affected by this phenomenon, including many in Africa.\n\nIn private online forums where women post under anonymity, distressing testimonies emerge about the violence they suffer within relationships. Out of respect and for the protection of those sharing their stories, no names or platform details are revealed. Behind these testimonies emerges a chilling reality: that of sexual relations imposed within marriage without the woman’s consent, in other words, the reality of marital rape.\n\nAs violence against women becomes increasingly common, consent is being trampled. The notion of “conjugal duty” still frequently outweighs a woman’s right to make decisions about her body.\n\nIt is in these digital spaces, where distress is voiced and violence normalized, that discussion groups take shape, embodying a form of digital sisterhood. Providing room for listening, support, and open speech, these spaces enable women to challenge together the taboos that restrict their empowerment, online as well as offline. This safe space where women share their experiences underlines the urgency of an open and courageous debate on marital rape in Africa.\n\nA cultural, religious, and legal debate\n\nIn May 2025, the program “Midi Plus” on TFM Télévision Futur Média, based in Senegal, gave national exposure to Oustaz Modou Fall, a Muslim authority in the country. This preacher claims that conjugal duty takes precedence over consent, thereby legitimizing sexual violence in the name of marriage. Speaking in Wolof, he stated:\n\nGnouni loi bi néna sakh sa diabar so beugué teud akk mom té dacoroul daga ko violé . Pfff wakhi dof ! Sa diabar ga takk ko so farata Yallah akk souna Seydouna Mohamed , touki Pape Samba dem tournage soneu baye beugu dé gnibissi beugu teud ak sokhname gnouniko bouné dama soneu damadone fobéré (rires) ga forcéko viol le. Boudé lou amm la , lane moye texte bi. Si diné.\n\nPeople say the law declares that if you force your wife to have sex, that counts as rape. Pfff — absurd, this is your wife, the one you married before God. You travel, you work, Pape Samba [the host], you come back exhausted, you want to be with your wife, and she refuses. She says she’s tired, that she was doing the housework (laughter). So if you insist, it’s rape? If that’s the case, which religious scripture says so? We must be cautious about this.\n\nThe broadcast immediately sparked indignation across social media. On TikTok, activists and legal experts mobilized. The Xam Sa Droit page published a series of videos challenging Modou Fall’s statements against existing legislation. Specifically, it points to Article 320 of Senegal’s Penal Code, which defines rape as any act of penetration “carried out through violence, coercion, threat or surprise.” This is a reminder that marriage does not take away any fundamental rights, and that refusing sex, even within a couple, remains an inalienable right. This effort at legal education was met with strong support on TikTok, as it put consent back at the center of the discussion.\n\nVoices were also raised on X. Nabou Diop Lo, a lawyer and activist for women’s and children’s rights, posted:\n\nLe viol tel que définit dans le code pénal Sénégalais ne fait pas une distinction entre le viol commis dans le ménage et celui commis hors des liens conjugaux. Tout ce qui compte c'est le consentement de la victime. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nRape, as defined in the Senegalese Penal Code, makes no distinction between rape committed within marriage and that committed outside it. What matters is the victim’s consent. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nBut how can a woman dare complain she's been raped when a religious figure claims that a wife’s “no” carries no weight? This dissonance between the law, public discourse, and women’s lived reality highlights the urgent need for legal reform and a clear stance from the authorities.\n\nBy normalizing marital rape, this official rhetoric entrenches an absolute claim over women’s bodies and heavily compounds the moral weight borne by potential victims.\n\nEquality Now’s 2024 report shows that the legal recognition of marital rape differs significantly across Africa. The report notes that countries such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Madagascar, Senegal, and Togo explicitly criminalize marital rape.\n\nIn countries including Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Tanzania, spouses are explicitly exempted from prosecution, except in exceptional cases.\n\nIn Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mali, Uganda, and Chad, the law remains silent on the matter, creating a complete legal void.\n\nSenegalese law on rape and paedophilia, revised in 2020, sets out the definition of rape as follows:\n\nTout acte de pénétration « commis par violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise ».\n\nAny act of penetration ‘committed by violence, coercion, threat, or surprise.’\n\nHowever, the lack of clear legal provisions on marital rape and spousal consent creates a wide scope for interpretation, often to the detriment of the victim. As a result, marital rape is often treated as an ordinary form of domestic violence, rather than classified as a criminal offence.\n\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, for example, an investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde published in February 2024 reported that a humorous TikTok video mocking women’s sexual fatigue sparked amused reactions — evidence that sexual non-consent is not taken seriously.\n\nAccording to figures published in African Health Sciences, 33 percent of women in Africa have been subjected to sexual violence at some point in their lives, with rates rising to 44 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Côte d’Ivoire, 40 percent of women housed in the shelter run by the NGO Akwaba Mousso say they have suffered marital rape.\n\nIn many African legal systems, including in Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, the implicit presumption of consent between spouses prevents marital rape from being effectively recognised as a crime.\n\nWhen feminists raise awareness on the subject, the issue is frequently minimised. In the previously mentioned Le Monde article, Ivorian activist Marie-Paule Okri, co-founder of the Ivorian League for Women’s Rights, told the journalist:\n\nQuand on essaie d’en parler, on nous répond qu’on exagère. On nous inculque depuis l’adolescence que le corps de la femme est fait pour donner du plaisir à l’homme.\n\nWhen we try to talk about it, we are told we are exaggerating. From adolescence, we are taught that a woman’s body exists to give pleasure to men.\n\nYet Article 14 of the Maputo Protocol commits African states to guaranteeing women’s fundamental rights, including health and reproductive consent.\n\nBeyond legislation, it will take a deep change in attitudes to improve women’s condition, grounded in respect for their bodies and equality in relationships.",

    "title": "A region on the brink: The global implications of the war on Gaza · Global Voices",
    "text": "On October 7, 2023, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), the group that governs the Palestinian territory of Gaza, breached the barrier that has surrounded the densely populated area for the last 16 years, preventing the free flow of people and goods. The militants then launched an attack on 22 nearby Israeli settlements, towns, and military bases, killing around 1,200 civilians and soldiers and taking at least 199 hostages.\n\nMany governments around the world have condemned the attack as a war crime and act of terror, while other governments blamed Israel for setting the stage for these attacks to take place. Since then, many governments have described Israel’s response as disproportionate: the official death toll now exceeds 40,000 Palestinians killed, including over 15,000 children — some experts estimate the actual number to be over four times higher.\n\nFor more, read Global Voices’ previous Special Coverage: Israel’s war on Gaza\n\nThe assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas Political Bureau, in Tehran on 31 July 2024, and a key Hezbollah military commander in Beirut on 30 July have significantly escalated tensions in the region. These targeted killings, combined with the failure to implement a ceasefire, are raising the risk of a war that could engulf the whole region, with potentially far-reaching consequences for global peace and stability.\n\nIsrael’s actions, including its military occupation, settlement expansion, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and recurrent operations in Gaza and the West Bank, have drawn widespread accusations of human rights violations and defiance of international law. This includes an International Court of Justice (ICJ) initial ruling on an ongoing case finding it plausible that Israel is committing genocide and an application by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for arrest warrants against three Hamas leaders — including Haniyeh — and two Israeli officials — including Prime Minister Netanyahu — for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe arrest warrants include one for Mohammed Deif, Commander-in-Chief of Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. the Israeli army claims to have assassinated Deif in an airstrike on July 13 in the Al Mawasi humanitarian safe zone in Gaza — one that killed at least 90 people in a massacre described by United Nations official Scott Anderson as “some of the most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.”\n\nIsrael's military operations and targeted assassinations in neighboring countries continue despite United Nations Security Council resolutions, global calls for a ceasefire, and repeated condemnations from international humanitarian organizations who have labeled them as violations of international humanitarian law. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached catastrophic levels, with an illegal blockade that has led to severe shortages of vital supplies and the threat of a poliovirus outbreak, exacerbating the suffering of the population, with nine out of 10 people internally displaced, many of them multiple times.\n\nThe international community’s failure to enforce a ceasefire or hold Israel accountable has highlighted the limitations of global institutions in managing the crises. The United Nations has failed to mediate effectively, with its resolutions ignored, and global and regional players have not put pressure on Israel to accept or implement ceasefire resolutions adopted by the UNSC or proposed by mediators. This raises significant questions about the effectiveness of international law in protecting civilians in conflict zones.\n\nIn this special coverage, we explore the regional and global implications as well as the challenges facing international law in addressing the ongoing crisis.",

    "title": "How one community in Trinidad & Tobago pushed the culinary boundaries of pigeon peas",
    "text": "By Natalie Briggs\n\nWhen I first met Florence Warrick-Joseph, there were two things I didn’t know. One, we were related in that pumpkin vine way only Caribbean people can be. Two, the doubles I had just bought from her at a pop-up market had a surprise in them.\n\nIt wasn’t the comforting warmth of a bara hot out of the box, leaking through greaseproof paper. It wasn’t the silken tear of teeth into that just-fried pillowy goodness, which, if you’re lucky, will still hold a hint of the crackle of oil.\n\nNo, it wasn’t that.\n\nIt was the filling. Cucumber, check. Sweet sauce, check. The heady bouquet of garlic, cumin and spices was there. But there was something different in the mouth feel. It wasn’t the melt-in-your-mouth consistency of the channa that makes doubles a national byword in Trinidad and Tobago. Tasty, yes … but different.\n\nThe same bouquet is heavy in Warrick-Joseph’s small kitchen, tickling the nostrils, making me think about the last time I ate. “I don’t curry the peas. I stew it,” she revealed, while demonstrating how she puts her spin on the popular street food. This is not her only departure from the norm. The peas she uses? They are pigeon peas.\n\nThese days, it isn’t quite the record scratch moment it was when it first appeared — but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. What we should be discussing is how pigeon peas, the stuff of pelau and coconut milk stew-downs, ended up in doubles. It started as an exhortation to think outside the box.\n\nIn 2014, Warrick-Joseph, a retired registered nurse, decided to do an event management course. Her lecturer asked the cohort to stretch themselves beyond the ho-hummery of birthday parties and christenings for their practicum. She was an avid planter of pigeon peas, one of the many members of the Upper Cemetery Street Residents’ Association in Diego Martin, to do so. They had a bumper crop that year.\n\n“We were walking back down the hill,” Warrick-Joseph recalled. “Me, Errol [her husband] and Mr. Timothy. And he asked what were we going to do with all these peas. My husband said, ‘We will freeze it, we will sell it.’ Because that is what people do to get money to put in the organisation. So I said, thinking out of the box, we could have a pigeon peas festival.”\n\nThe two men were sceptical. Warrick-Joseph continued, “They were like, ‘Nobody ever heard of a pigeon peas festival.’ I said, ‘I’ve heard of a mango festival. I’ve heard of a breadfruit festival. There’s a chocolate festival. Why not pigeon peas?’”\n\nThe stage was set, but the main players were yet to arrive. They had the peas, but it would literally take a village to showcase their versatility. By the time the first festival rolled around in 2015, it was a result of a true community effort. They were able to generate so many recipes, including a version of doubles, that there were enough to fill a commemorative book.\n\n“We got someone to do pholourie,” Warrick-Joseph said. “We got somebody who could do pigeon peas accra. Everybody ended up taking a recipe. We found people in the community who could do these things. The pigeon peas roti was from a woman who did roti, and instead of using the dhal with the split peas, she used the pigeon peas.”\n\nPholourie? Accra? Roti? It wasn’t such a stretch of the imagination. After all, pigeon peas’ nutty, earthy flavour lends itself well to a variety of savoury preparations. That’s why it’s a perennial favourite across the Caribbean.\n\nBut Warrick-Joseph was about to hit me another curveball. That first festival, she came up with four of her own recipes. One for ice cream. One for a punch. One for a pigeon peas wine. Then one for a liqueur. Two of those are sweet. One of them officially qualifies as dessert. The trick was in picking, shelling and stewing the fresh pigeon peas to form the custard base all within 24 hours, while they were still full of flavour. My mind had more difficulty wrapping around the idea of pigeon peas as this creamy, cold concoction.\n\nThere were no such problems with the muffins. As I stood and watched her prepare them, different scents filled the kitchen, this time with her signature spice blend. It was the spice, I realised, that gave it the illusion of being sweet. I hadn’t seen her put a lot of sugar into the mixture. The eventual result was dense, reminding me more of a coconut drop than the traditional muffin with its cakey crumb. Fresh out of the oven, breaking into one was a treat; I could smell the spices wafting up from the steamy centre. There was nutmeg. Some cinnamon, too.\n\nNothing in the flavour screamed pigeon peas. That was more in the texture and the solidity with which it sat in my stomach. One muffin felt like a full meal, which led me to ask about the nutritional benefits of the pigeon peas substitution. I found out that, among other things, they were high in potassium and fibre, and were good for gut flora, diabetics, and women who wanted to lose weight.\n\nIn fact, it was trying to cater to customers who wanted healthier alternatives to doubles that prompted Warrick-Joseph to come up with a recipe for gluten-free bara, made with pigeon pea flour: “The reason for the switch was that people felt they wanted gluten-free. There was a group of people that was intolerant to normal flour.”\n\nThese were what I had really come to see her prepare, the muffins being a delectable side journey. I knew it would be different from the first doubles I had from her, since the bara in that one had been made the regular way, with flour, leavening agent and oil. How different this version would be, both in taste and feel, was left to be seen.\n\nIt was a three-flour mix, including the ground pigeon peas, which resulted in a tacky, sticky sort of dough that was allowed to rest for about half an hour. While it did that, Warrick-Joseph warmed the oil in which she would fry them later, and prepared the pigeon peas filling. We talked about many things while she did this, including her business and her plans to eventually have pre-packaged products in the supermarket.\n\nWhen she deemed the dough ready, she put the peas aside. The low gluten content made it difficult to handle as it tears easily, which is why she prefers to use a pastelle press to shape them, instead of rolling them out the traditional way. From there, the perfect circles went into the warmed oil, where they puff up slightly — nothing like the regular bara, because of the low gluten content. By the time they are done, I’m itching to try them.\n\nWarrick-Joseph presented them to me on a plate, complete with pigeon peas filling, cucumber and a tangy tamarind sweet sauce. I took a bite, and chewed slowly, trying to make up my mind about them. The verdict? All the elements were there. This tasted like doubles. Purists might draw the line at the bara, which was more reminiscent of a soft taco shell — flatter, with a slight, mealy crunch to it — while health enthusiasts might hail it as the thing to make doubles great again.",

    "text": "Exile Hub is one of Global Voices’ partners in Southeast Asia, emerging in response to the 2021 coup in Myanmar, focusing on empowering journalists and human rights defenders. This edited article is republished under a content partnership agreement.\n\nMost people spend their lives running away from danger. Esther ran toward it.\n\nAfter finding refuge in Australia under UNHCR protection, she made the bold decision to return to the Thailand–Myanmar border in 2023 to continue her journalism. Now, in 2025, she reports from one of Myanmar’s most dangerous conflict zones often under fire, often uncertain of tomorrow. Yet she remains unshaken.\n\nIn a world where silence is safe, Esther chooses the frontline. Her weapon is truth, and she wields it for those who cannot.\n\nA journey against the current\n\nBorn in Mon State in 1993, Esther has always been someone who could not ignore injustice.\n\n“I have never been able to lie to myself or live in misery. If something doesn’t sit right with me, I have to face it head-on,” she reflects.\n\nLike many young people in Myanmar, Esther initially wandered through different jobs, unsure of her calling. She translated movies, worked as a travel and tour sales representative, and later became a public relations officer at a Korean company. But none of these roles felt right.\n\n“I couldn’t stay where I felt trapped or compromised,” she shares.\n\nHer turning point came in 2018 when she attended a basic journalism course. “That’s when I realized writing and sharing opinions was what I had always loved. It felt like home.” After the course ended, she landed her first journalism job at an ethnic media house.\n\nWhen the coup changed everything\n\nBy 2021, Esther was working with a major media house. When the coup hit, her newsroom relocated to Karenni State, and Esther went with them, continuing to report under dangerous conditions. But even after escaping to Australia for safety, the pull of truth was stronger than comfort. In 2023, she made the decision to return.\n\nA few months after she arrived in Thailand, the military made a desperate announcement. In February 2024, the military reactivated its conscription law, mandating that men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 serve in the army. Evading service or helping someone evade could lead to five years in prison.\n\n“As the number of these conscription stories grew, so did my determination to report them,” Esther recalls. But working as an exiled independent journalist came with its own struggles. With no regular income and the constant need for resources, continuing her work was a challenge. That’s when she applied for Exile Hub’s Critical Voices Fellowship 2024 and received it.\n\nBearing witness on the frontlines\n\nEsther began collecting stories from those most affected. She spoke with young men who had fled their villages, fearful of being conscripted. She also interviewed women who had watched brothers and husbands taken by the army, leaving families uncertain and anxious about their loved ones’ fate.\n\nIn September 2024, she published “I Don’t Want Others to Face What I Faced: Stories of Forced Military Conscription,” giving a voice to those the regime wanted silenced.\n\nLater, she followed with another hard-hitting piece, “Snatched from Their Beds, Taken on the Streets — The Young Men in Myanmar Forced to Fight the Junta’s Losing War.”\n\nToday, Esther works deep inside one of Myanmar’s most volatile conflict zones, a place where the sound of gunfire and the threat of airstrikes are constant. Despite the risks, she is satisfied with witnessing the truth with her eyes and documenting and reporting on it.\n\nEsther is more than a journalist. She is a lifeline for those whose cries would otherwise vanish in the dark. And no matter the risk, she will keep writing and keep reporting, because for her, silence is never an option.",

    "text": "Environmental groups initiated global activities and protests from September 18 to 21 to drumbeat the call for urgent climate action amid the worsening pollution and continuing deterioration of the natural ecosystem. The series of protests were held right before the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and less than six weeks away from the UN Climate Summit (COP30) in Brazil.\n\nIn Asia, the “Draw the Line” campaign highlighted the demand to phase out fossil fuels, build renewables, shift to sustainable food, and prioritize the people’s basic needs over corporate interests.\n\nSeveral countries participated in the campaign led by a network of environmental groups and community-based organizations.\n\nIn the Philippines, the campaign was actively supported by local groups resisting projects and policies that threaten the lives and livelihoods of rural and coastal communities. A fluvial protest was organized in the town of Culasi in Antique province, located in the Visayas islands of the Philippines, to call attention to the demand of the small fisherfolk against the entry of commercial fishing operations in municipal waters. Javie Barcinal of 350.org Asia echoed the stand of small fishers.\n\nSmall fishers are among the worst affected by the climate crisis, with warming seas resulting in dwindling catches each year. To make matters worse, the government has allowed industrial fishing to encroach into municipal waters. This exacerbates climate injustice that small fishers experience as hunger for their families.\n\nIn Indonesia, environmnetalists organized at least 36 actions in 34 cities and provinces across the country on September 18, to push for bold reforms in government policies. A march was held towards the State Palace on September 19 as rallyists reiterated the anti-corruption demands of the youth-led protests that erupted in the country last month. Sisilia Nurmala Dewi of 350.org Indonesia led climate advocates in asserting an end to corruption to fund a better future.\n\nWe draw the line as flash floods drown the innocent, while people’s voices against government failures are being silenced. Oligarchs and polluters have ruled this country for far too long, taking public money for climate action and destroying natural resources that should be preserved for future generations. We demand real, decisive action. President Prabowo must honor his promises by committing to 100 percent renewable energy in 10 years and a clear immediate plan to phase-out coal plants.\n\nPaskah Toga of Climate Rangers Bali cited the recent flooding disaster in Bali island to rally public opposition against fossil-based power plants.\n\nThe recent deadly floods in Bali is clear evidence that the climate crisis is no longer a distant threat but a reality that needs to be resolved with concrete policies. The government must stop building fossil-based power plants and phase out fossil fuels.\n\nIn Japan, protesters challenged the new leadership to phase out fossil fuels and to reverse policies that blame immigrants for the country’s social woes. Masayoshi Iyoda, 350.org Japan campaigner, summed up their demand.\n\nWe draw the line on Japan’s rising contributions to climate chaos and war. As we experience both flash floods and extreme heat, workers suffer and food prices continue to soar. Japan’s new leadership must show political will to phase out fossil fuels and shift to 100% renewables, instead of going with the far-right tide of blaming immigrants for our economic woes and backsliding on climate action.\n\nThe protest was also attended by activists who expressed solidarity with Palestinians by condemning the continuous bombings and military attacks in Gaza.\n\nIn South Korea, Jiyun Gim of the Green Environment Youth Korea urged authorities to comply with the planned emissions reduction this year.\n\nSouth Korea’s 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) will be determined in November. We are drawing the line to prevent South Korea from setting a climate goal that falls below 60% emissions reduction. This is not just about numbers—it is the survival line for future generations. The government must set ambitious, science-based, and future-oriented climate targets.\n\nIn Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh, community residents staged an action denouncing the planned revival of a coal plant. Shahrukh Karim, a youth leader in Matarbari, articulated the sentiments of the local community.\n\nWe are burning, our lands are dying, and our rivers are drying up. We draw the line on building another coal plant, when the existing one has already driven away thousands of families and turned our homes into a wasteland. This needs to stop.\n\nCommunities Draw the Line on Matarbari Coal Plant 2 Revival https://t.co/2IT1VPkF5P pic.twitter.com/9E05xBK9xV — Energy & Power (@enpbd) September 20, 2025\n\nIn an email interview with Global Voices, 350.org Asia Communications Manager Ilang-Ilang Quijano shared their initial plans on how to sustain the campaign.",

    "title": "Africa charts bold path towards green inclusive development at the second Africa Climate Summit",
    "text": "Over 6,000 delegates gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, for the second Africa Climate Summit (ACS2), held from September 8 to 10, to search for Africa-driven solutions ahead of negotiations for the United Nations 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the world's largest annual environmental conference.\n\nThe second Africa Climate Summit was organized to unite African leaders, youth, and partners in pushing for fair climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s role as a solutions hub, while preparing a common position ahead of COP30 negotiations. It was a pivotal moment for Africa to stake its claim as a leader in the global climate conversation. Leaders, activists, and young innovators came together to push for reforms in climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s youth voices. The gathering was themed around “Accelerating Global Climate Solutions: Financing for Africa’s Resilient and Green Development.” Ethiopia’s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, opened the event with a keynote that set the tone:\n\nAfrica should not be seen only as a victim of climate challenges, but as a continent of solutions and innovations that could guide the world forward.\n\nHe also proposed the “Africa Climate Innovation Compact” to produce 1,000 innovators by 2030, financed and owned by Africans.\n\nThis vision was built on the momentum of the inaugural summit in Nairobi in 2023, which, importantly, was preceded by the African Youth Climate Assembly (AYCA). By doing so, organizers ensured that the majority-youth population of Africa was not just represented but central to shaping the conversation.\n\nThe challenges Africa faces\n\nAfrica continues to wrestle with the painful legacy of historical injustice and the harsh reality of a deepening climate crisis. Despite contributing the least to global emissions, the continent feels the impacts most acutely. Climate finance remains painfully inadequate as wealthy nations have consistently fallen short of their yearly pledge, and African countries today pay back about five times more in debt servicing than they receive in climate aid.\n\nThe cost of this imbalance is causing hospitals to stretch beyond capacity as diseases like malaria and cholera spread more widely under shifting climatic conditions. Crops are failing under the weight of prolonged droughts or sudden floods, leaving farmers with empty fields and families without food. Coastal cities, from Lagos to Dar es Salaam, face rising waters that sweep away homes, businesses, and livelihoods.\n\nYet at the same time, Africa holds some of the richest renewable resources on the planet. If harnessed, its solar capacity alone could power the world many times over. Africa holds 17 percent of the world’s population but receives just 3 percent of global climate investment. Restrictive financial systems and predatory loan arrangements often force African countries back into reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nEcoVista, a youth-led ecological justice movement whose main focus is on climate justice and the environment, based in Nairobi, Kenya posted on its X account:\n\nFossil fuels are the biggest driver of the climate crisis, responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. #MakeThemPay\n\nDraw The Line pic.twitter.com/N9aUDWl8e8 — EcoVistaKe (@EcoVistaKE) September 19, 2025\n\nLayered on top of that is a painful reminder of colonial history. While Africa’s minerals powered industrial growth in the Global North, the continent was left behind with ecological damage and struggling economies. Yearly natural disasters including cyclones, floods, and expanding deserts displace millions every year, and pushed African leaders at ACS2 to adopt the Addis Ababa Declaration, a clear and urgent call for change.\n\nWith regard to the consequences facing Africa, Tangwa Abilu, a Cameroonian Climate and Environmental Activist, shared on X :\n\nThe horn of Africa is grieving because their\n\n-Their farms are no longer yielding\n\n-Advancement of desert is alarming\n\n-Our major rivers are drying\n\n-Proliferation of pest and pathogens\n\n-Development of tropical diseases.\n\n-Our crop are dieing out.\n\nClimate change is a reality. pic.twitter.com/2MQ5fZG1Zo — Tangwa Abilu.🌿🌏🌾🍀🍃.SDG's. (@AbiluTangwa) December 29, 2024\n\nIn the same context, K. Diallo, an African author, drew attention to the damage caused by floods in December 2023. He posted on his X account:\n\nflood disaster in the DR Congo is a result of global warming meeting a failed state…..The global South bears more than 95% of the costs and deaths related to climate change despite making up less than 5% of consumption-based cumulative emissions above 350ppm CO2. pic.twitter.com/vTDobNNVl5 — K.Diallo ☭ (@nyeusi_waasi) December 31, 2023\n\nDemands ahead of COP30\n\nFor African leaders, climate finance must shift from symbolic promises to meaningful reparations. They argue that financing should come as debt-free grants rather than loans that deepen dependency. Historic polluters owe this to frontline communities losing their farms to drought or their homes to rising seas. The Loss and Damage Fund, in particular, needs to prioritize these vulnerable communities with direct, rapid assistance: cash for families in sinking villages, support for starved farmlands, and investment in healthcare for climate-induced trauma. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said:\n\nToo often, Africa's story begins with what we lack: finance, technology, time. Let us instead begin with what we have: the youngest population in the world, vast solar resources, and the resilience to build a new climate economy.\n\nLeaders are also demanding stronger commitments from rich nations. During last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries from the global north pledged to pay USD300 billion in climate finance, but the amount falls far short of the USD1.3 trillion per year needed by African nations, who need it to effectively adapt and transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nACS2 came at a crucial moment when the Lake Chad Basin, which once supported millions across Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic, had shrunk by over 90 percent. With it, the livelihoods of countless families have evaporated. Africa is both the most vulnerable to climate collapse and one of the most promising centers for climate solutions. As the world heads towards COP30 in Brazil in November, Africans say they do not just want to be heard, but are demanding to be recognized as solution builders and shapers of the planet’s shared future.",

    "title": "The legacy of ‘sponge cities’ left by Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian",
    "text": "Yu Kongjian (俞孔坚), 62, the Chinese landscape architect who pioneered the concept of “sponge cities,” died in a plane crash in the Pantanal region, the largest tropical wetland in the world, in Brazil, on September 23, 2025. Three other people also died during the accident: pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, and filmmakers Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., who were both working with Yu to create a documentary about sponge cities. The cause of the crash is under investigation.\n\nFerraz’s work focused on nonfiction productions, including a series about the 2016 plane crash involving the Brazilian football team, Chapecoense. Crispim Jr. worked on projects such as a documentary about Brazilian architect Vilanova Artigas and another about the first women’s football national team in Brazil.\n\nBrazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, posted condolences on his X account and highlighted Yu's work:\n\nFoi com tristeza e consternação que recebi a notícia do desastre aéreo ocorrido no Pantanal no início da noite desta terça-feira, 23. A tragédia, infelizmente, custou as vidas do piloto Marcelo Pereira de Barros, dos documentaristas Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz e Rubens… — Lula (@LulaOficial) September 24, 2025\n\nIt was with sadness and consternation that I received the news about the aircraft disaster that happened in the Pantanal regional, early Tuesday night, the 23rd. The tragedy, unfortunately, took the lives of the pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, documentarians Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., and the Chinese architect Kongjian Yu. In times of climate change, Kongjian Yu became a world reference for sponge cities, which unite life quality and environment protection: something we want — and need — for the future. To all the victims’ friends, family and coworkers, I leave my deepest sorrows.\n\nYu’s legacy\n\nYu was in Brazil to work on a documentary, but he had also recently attended the São Paulo International Architecture Biennale, which was themed “EXTREMES — Architectures for an overheated planet.” Raquel Schenkman, the Institute of Brazilian Architects’ president, responsible for the Biennale’s organization, told G1 Yu was “someone on the frontline of transformations in big urban centers facing climate change.”\n\nOn its website, the Biennale published a note saying that, as the “creator of the theory of sponge cities, Yu Kongjian left a monumental legacy, also urgent to face climate crisis in cities,” and that his work, based on ecosystemic principles, “showed in a practical and poetic way how the landscape can be a vital infrastructure to urban resilience, integrating man to nature in a sustainable way.”\n\nSponge cities concept\n\nYu’s main legacy is designing and implementing projects based on his sponge cities theory. A professor at Peking University, his “sponge city” concept became a top national priority in China in 2013, following the massive floods in the Beijing region in 2012, which left 79 people dead and tens of thousands displaced. He also founded Turenscape, one of the main landscape architecture firms in the world, based in China.\n\nYu cautioned against overly “grey” cities that rely too much on concrete and asphalt, which disrupt natural water pathways and prevent the ground from absorbing water. While conventional water management focuses on draining water through engineered drainage infrastructure, such as pipes and water channels, sponge cities rely on techniques such as green roofs, rainwater storage and infiltration systems, sunken green spaces, permeable pavement, bioretention ponds, wetland revitalization, restoring natural waterflow pathways, and more.\n\n“Floods are not enemies,” Yu explained in an interview with WeForum. “We can make friends with floods. We can make friends with water.”\n\nYu’s approach to urban planning has been successfully implemented in dozens of cities in China, particularly after Chinese President Xi Jinping established his thoughts on ecological civilization in 2018.\n\nIn the past decade, his natural landscape approach is becoming an important tool in city planning and water management around the world.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, where recurring extreme weather events routinely cause massive floods that displace hundreds of thousands, many city planners are looking to sponge cities as a potential solution for unprecedented levels of rainfall.\n\nSo far, the concept has mostly been implemented on a small scale in individual neighborhoods, streets, or areas, meaning its flood mitigation impacts are often limited to the local level, rather than city- or nationwide.\n\nOn X, Zhongshan city's tourism promotion outlet, commemorates Yu's death by highlighting one of his landscape projects in the southern Chinese city:\n\nOn September 23 (Brazilian time), Professor Yu Kongjian from the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at #Peking University, tragically passed away in a plane crash at the age of 62. Professor Yu had won numerous world-class #design awards, including the Oberlander Prize and the John Cobb Common Good Award. Among his representative works is the #QijiangPark in #Zhongshan, #Guangdong . This #park, transformed from the site of a former shipyard, opened in 2001 and quickly gained global attention, winning several domestic and international design awards. In designing and building the park, Professor Yu and his team preserved the original industrial relics, such as shipyard machinery, docks, and other structures, and repurposed them with new functions. [original English version from @Amzhongshan]\n\nYu himself acknowledged that scaling up the pilot projects in Chinese cities was challenging. One of his sponge city projects in Zhengzhou faced backlash after a severe flood in 2021, which claimed 12 lives in the city, prompting many to express doubts about the practicality of his idea. Moreover, as China's coastal regions are highly industrialized, they demand cross-departmental collaboration, strong political will, and extensive administrative coordination to restore concrete riverbanks and seawalls to wetlands.\n\nIn an interview with Brazilian news outlet G1, Yu said that on a scale of 1 to 10, his optimism regarding the world’s chances of reversing climate change ranked 4. He also mentioned water scarcity — one of the challenges his projects aimed to address — as the primary issue humanity will face over the next 25 years.\n\nA journalist living in China, Isabela Shi, shared Yu Kongjian’s last update on a Chinese social media platform:\n\n🕯️No último vídeo que o arquiteto chinês Yu Kongjian divulgou na rede social chinesa, ele estava mostrando a viagem a Pantanal com equipa brasileira que tenta refletir sobre Planeta Esponja através de encolhimento de zonas húmidas. “Wonderful, amazing”, encantou ele pro Brasil. pic.twitter.com/fKn5ZKgIwe — Isabela Shi🇨🇳🇧🇷 (@ShiIsabela) September 25, 2025",

    "title": "How a comics school taught perseverance and creative freedom in Bosnia & Herzegovina",
    "text": "This article by Adin Kadrić first appeared in Balkan Diskurs on September 12, 2025. An edited version is being republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement with the Post-Conflict Research Center (PCRC).\n\nEditor's note: Zenica is a city in the middle of Bosnia and Herzegovina with about 100,000 residents. It is noted for its ironworks industry as well as being home to one of the big prisons in ex-Yugoslavia, described in the cult rock song Zenica Blues. It is not often considered when speaking about art, making the significance of this initiative — which began during the war of 1992-1995 and still persists to this day — even more extraordinary.\n\nFor over 30 years, the Zenica School of Comics has been not only an illustration school but a symbol of perseverance, cultural resistance, and lasting dedication to art. Initially conceived as an escape from the repression of the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and later, a platform for expression and creativity, the school has trained around 200 young artists. About 70 of them have gone on to become prominent young authors, whose works have left a mark on the domestic and regional comics scene.\n\nSeveral graduates are even acclaimed beyond the borders of their country, with Kenan Halilović, Biljana Šafaražik, and Zdravko Cvjetković being some of the most prominent. While the school has been synonymous with quality and creativity within the domestic comic scene for years, the international acclaim for these artists’ work underscores the fact that Zenica maintains a firm foothold in this visual medium.\n\nRecalling its beginnings, Adnadin Jašarević, the school’s founder and director of the Zenica City Museum, said that its primary goal was to give children a creative escape from the harsh realities of war. Under such conditions, comics were like Alice in Wonderland — providing an escape from hunger, fear, and shelling. An average of ten students still pass through the school every year, learning how to translate their thoughts, fears, and hopes into dynamic sequences of frames and speech clouds.\n\nNewer names like Filip Andronik, Milorad Vicanović, Senad Mavrić, and Enis Čišić represent the contemporary wave of comic artists from BiH. They actively cooperate with renowned publishers from the United States and Europe, demonstrating that despite its underdeveloped infrastructure, Bosnia and Herzegovina has comic creators who can stand equally alongside the best talent the genre has to offer.\n\nPublications such as “Horostop,” “ZE strip,” “EKO strip” and “SUV – Steps in Time” were created at the Zenica School, showcasing both its longevity and its dedication to comic culture. Explaining that the students themselves choose the topics they work on according to their own interests, Jašarević noted that he has “never stopped working” to ensure that comics remain a tool for expression and creative release.\n\nAs far as technology’s impact on the comic industry goes, Jašarević explained that while comics used to be widely available to the masses, they are now becoming a far more exclusive product, with expensive integral editions and albums intended for a small but loyal audience. While the idea behind ​​comics as a liberating medium remains the same, the development of technology has heralded a turn in modern-day comic production.\n\nCartoonist and former Zenica student Zdravko Cvjetković, in speaking about the impact of technology, emphasized that smart tablets have made drawing easier and faster for many artists, without compromising the quality of their work. However, he warned that AI tools — such as those used for generating text and images — pose serious ethical and aesthetic questions.\n\nHe believes that the mass availability of tools that produce images and stories in seconds, threatens to trivialize art and blur the line between creativity and automation: “If we all become artists just because we have a tool in our pocket, then nobody is really an artist.”\n\nMany things about comics today, according to Cvjetković, are drastically different than before the war: “Comics are no longer accessible to such a wide audience, especially children. They’re too expensive and rarely found in newsstands.”\n\nThe burgeoning Bosnian comics scene\n\nPointing out that children today reach for screens before print media like comics or books, Cvjetković said that publishers are therefore targeting older generations who grew up with comics.\n\nA positive outcome of this is the growing number of comics festivals in the region, which promote a culture of reading and drawing. “Workshops and comics contests for children [are] an almost mandatory part of every serious festival,” Cvjetković emphasized, “and this is crucial in the absence of comics schools like the one in Zenica.”\n\nComics culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina persists despite its modest ecosystem, in which there is almost no institutional support, and few major publishers or specialized festivals. However, thanks to the enthusiasm of individuals, the scene is not disappearing; in fact, it is quietly but steadily growing.\n\nAuthors like Berin Tuzlić and Enis Čišić have been representing BiH on the regional and international comics scene for years. Tuzlić, known for his experimental approach and multimedia projects, combines comics with music and animation. Čišić, who also tried his hand at Marvel productions, represents a more contemporary, technically precise form of expression. Their work shows that the country is producing talent capable of competing globally.\n\nIsmet Erdić also holds a special place on the BiH comics scene, with his rare combination of historical storytelling and visual narration in comics about Kulin Ban and medieval Bosnia. His work has educational value and is often used in classrooms, which makes him one of the few authors whose comics reach the general public.\n\nDespite unfavorable conditions for comic distribution, publicity, and marketing, comics culture in BiH is still preserved as a niche interest by enthusiasts. Social networks, web comics, and regional cooperation with authors from Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia are currently key to their survival. So, while relatively small, the BiH comics scene has an authentic flair and great potential, waiting for better times ahead.",

    "title": "Civil society initiative fights for equal education opportunities in Togo",
    "text": "In Togo, a national initiative built on civic solidarity helps relieve parents’ yearly back-to-school expenses.\n\nEducation is free and compulsory throughout the country, with a population of over 9.5 million. Following a two-month break (from mid-July to mid-September), more than 3 million students returned to school this month. While the authorities continue to work on improving education through teacher training and recruitment, investing in renovations and school infrastructure, the parents’ main priority is seeing their children succeed at the end of each school year.\n\nOver the years, there has been a marked increase in the gross enrollment rate and the proportion of Togolese students completing the school year. In April 2025, the local news website Lechiquier published:\n\n…le taut brut de scolarisation au primaire dépasse 100%. Il était de l’ordre de 111,70% en 2023, 116,70% en 2024 et une prévision de 116,20% pour l’année 2025. Dans le même sillage, le taux d’achèvement du primaire a évolué de 88,80% en 2023 à 94,60% en 2024. Pour l’année 2025, le gouvernement table sur une augmentation de 121,70%.\n\nThe gross primary school enrolment rate now exceeds 100 percent. In 2023, it was approximately 111.70 percent, in 2024 it was 116.70 percent, and 116.20 percent is forecast for 2025. Similarly, the primary school completion rate increased from 88.80 percent in 2023 to 94.60 percent in 2024. For 2025, the government forecasts an increase to 121.70 percent.\n\nThis rate of over 100 percent is due to it far exceeding the initial estimated value.\n\nFree school education\n\nTogo is one of five African countries with high enrollment rates in school, an impressive development stemming from the various reforms the authorities have implemented in the education sector. In 2008, Togo introduced free pre-school and primary education in the public sector. Since the beginning of the 2021–2022 school year, education in public secondary schools has also been free, a measure the authorities will maintain for the 2025–2026 school year.\n\nThese measures help combat inequities in accessing education. However, efforts, such as providing student school kits (notebooks, books, pens, pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, and school bags), are still required to tackle inequality and ensure universal coverage.\n\nTogo’s guaranteed monthly minimum wage (SMIG) increased from FCFA 35,000 (USD 64) in 2012 to FCFA 52,500 (USD 95) in early 2023. Although this measure was introduced to support the Togolese working population of over 4 million, not all are content with its implementation, condemning the country’s ongoing poor economic situation and challenging living conditions.\n\nAssociation contributions\n\nGiven the financial crisis, parents’ biggest concern is purchasing back-to-school supplies and kits. However, Togolese civil society provides solutions. Citizens, both young and old, are quick to lend their support to help parents meet these expenses.\n\nNumerous citizens, working as part of various associations, travel to the country’s villages and remote areas, assisting and supporting children, especially the most vulnerable. These efforts are a social and solidarity-based alternative to the associations committed to child protection, education, and development.\n\nOne example is Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (the Togolese Child Protection Association or LTPE). On August 29, 2025, LTPE supported 5,000 children from 12 villages of the Amou Prefecture in the Plateaux region.\n\nLe 29 août 2025, plus de 5 000 enfants de la préfecture d’Amou venus de 12 localités différentes ont reçu des kits scolaires grâce à l’initiative « Éducation pour tous : 1 élève, 1 kit, 1 choix de vie » portée par la #LTPE. pic.twitter.com/LMroVuE9oY — Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (@LTPE_ONG) August 30, 2025\n\nOn August 29, 2025, more than 5,000 children from 12 different locations in the Amou Prefecture received school kits through the #LTPE initiative ‘Education for All: One student, one kit, one life choice.’\n\nIn an interview with Togolese media outlet Plume d'Afrique, Nina Afi Kazoulé, the LTPE coordinator, explained the scope of this measure:\n\nNous voulons par cette action éviter le décrochage scolaire. Et nous savons que le décrochage scolaire peut être dû à l'incapacité financière des parents, aux grossesses en milieu scolaire, bref à tous les comportements qui ne sont pas appropriés à adopter par un apprenant.\n\nWe want to prevent school dropouts with this measure. We know that school dropouts can happen due to the parents’ lack of financial resources, pregnancies among school girls, or any inappropriate student behavior\n\nIn the village of Zooti N'titikope, Vogan, a town 45 kilometers northwest of the Togolese capital Lomé, the Togovi Bé Sourire association and Action for Peace and Good Governance (APGG) joined forces with several other associations on September 5 and 6 to support young learners. More than 300 vulnerable children received school kits, and 20 young girls will be monitored and supported in successfully reintegrating into school.\n\nLomé also has vulnerable children supported by other groups, including the Premiers Pas pour l’Enfance (First Steps for Children or 3PE) association. Its mission is to promote equal education opportunities through solidarity initiatives, such as the payment of school fees and supply provision for children. Association President Akilou Demon told media outlet Ledefenseur:\n\nNous voulons que tous les enfants aient accès à l’éducation, car l’enfant a droit à l’école. Si certains en sont privés, ce n’est pas juste. Notre ambition est de leur donner une chance égale de réussir et de contribuer demain au développement de notre patrie.\n\nAs children have the right to attend school, we want all children to have access to education. Some are deprived, and this is not fair. We aim to give them equal opportunities to succeed and one day contribute to our country’s development.\n\nAlthough the results of various reforms are visible, shortcomings remain in Togo’s education system.\n\nSchool infrastructure, such as classrooms, is substandard, especially in villages. Students study in straw huts with few school benches (supplemented in some places with bricks) and are forced to move or interrupt their lessons due to adverse weather conditions. In 2021, these circumstances led to construction plans for 30,000 classrooms equipped with wooden class benches. However, in September 2024, the government reduced its improvement projects by more than half, going from 30,000 classrooms to just 14,632.\n\nWhile civil society can offset some of the education system’s shortcomings, it’s ultimately up to the state, which declared education free and compulsory, to improve education quality and train new teachers to achieve equal opportunities for all Togolese children.",

    "title": "In Brazil, Romani people living in peripheral areas fight for recognition of their identities",
    "text": "This article, written by Artur Ferreira and Amanda Oliveira, was originally published on May 30, 2025, on the Agência Mural website. An edited version is published on Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nIn the collective imagination, the Romani people are associated with colourful clothing, parties, accessories, and an aura of mystery, embodying a wandering spirit. But beyond the stereotypes, there is a rich history of resistance and belonging that spans centuries, including in Brazil, in the outskirts of São Paulo.\n\nIn universities, public offices, doctors’ offices, or their traditional campsites, they are fighting for their rights, against prejudice, and for recognition in a country where there are still shortcomings in caring for the diversity of these communities.\n\nIn Itaim Paulista, a neighbourhood at the eastern end of the city, 250 people live in one of the main and oldest Romani campsites in the region.\n\n“Some Romanies palm read, dance, get dressed up in traditional clothing, but some are even evangelical, like myself, and they don’t all even live in camps. We are a people like any other,” the 32-year-old housewife Magda Santos says. She has been living in the camps for eight years with her husband and two children. “I am not Romani by blood, but I became one when I got married to one.”\n\nThe Romani, also known as the Roma peoples, are an ethnic group that doesn’t have a single origin. One of the more widely accepted theories is that they are of Indian origin but have travelled the world since the 11th century in a great diaspora, dispersing throughout the Balkans, Western Europe, and later to other continents.\n\nWhile she was hanging clothes on the clothesline, 29-year-old seamstress Viviane Alves Pereira made sure to find an answer when asked about the main problems her people face. The statement came without hesitation: prejudice, invisibility and the lack of access to basic rights, a common scenario in marginalized neighbourhoods.\n\nWho are the Roma people from the outskirts?\n\nThe majority of Romani who live on the outskirts of Greater São Paulo are of the Calon ethnicity, like Magda and Viviane. They are also those who suffer the most prejudice relating to maintaining their traditions and being most recognized as “gypsies” (a term now considered derogatory), because of their clothing and their nomadic lifestyle, according to sources from this report.\n\nIn Brazil, there are two other Romani ethnic groups: the Roma and the Sinti peoples. They don’t wear traditional clothing, so they mostly go unnoticed in the cities.\n\n“Many Brazilians were already cared for by doctors, nurses and Romani lawyers, and maybe they don’t even know,” states activist Nicolas Ramanush, 64, who is the president of the NGO, Romani Embassy of Brazil (Embaixada Cigana do Brasil), in Santo André in the Greater São Paulo area.\n\n“In the region, Romani people were concentrated in the neighborhood of Itaim Paulista and in the cities of Itaquaquecetuba and Itapevi, with camps near the train stations,” he says.\n\nEach ethnicity is divided into subgroups, and each one develops its own customs, habits, religions and rituals. “In my ethnic group, for example, we always wear decorated shoes with a lot of details. Some Calon women are famous for their flowery dresses and for using handkerchiefs,” says Ramanush, who belongs to the Sinti ethnicity.\n\nThis group has the fewest number of people in the country. “Today, if there are 100 families in Brazil, it is a lot,” says Ramanush. “This is because of the period of Nazism. The Sintis were almost exterminated. Among the Romani killed during the Holocaust, the majority were Sinti and Roma,” he adds.\n\nRamanush notes that many aspects of Romani culture are integrated into the Brazilian lifestyle without most people realizing it. They were among those responsible for helping Carnival to grow, especially in the northeast, creating Carnival street blocks. Certain costumes, such as “La Ursa” (The Bear) in Recife, have a Romani origin.\n\n“Instruments like the seven or six-string guitar were brought to Brazil by the Roma people. Some samba dancers spoke about how living with the Romanies inspired them musically,” Ramanush says.\n\nUnder the canvas tents\n\nNomadic and outskirt-dwelling Romani have a routine defined by difficulties surrounding education for their children and lack of healthcare, caused by the lack of a stable address. They also face São Paulo’s structural problems, such as floods, and living under canvas tents, without safety.\n\nOne of the most impactful natural disasters was the flooding in February 2025 in the far east of São Paulo, in the region known as Jardim Pantanal. The streets and houses remained underwater for several days. The Romani in these camps had to face that situation under the tents.\n\n“We spent days underwater, and it was the neighbors from the region who helped us,” Santos remembers with outrage.\n\nThe camp’s inhabitants had to deal with a lack of drinking water; tents were affected, and according to local accounts, they had to make a joint effort to avoid major losses of furniture and appliances while the flooding advanced.\n\nJust like Santos, Ramanush believes that the first step to improving the Romani community’s life in the outskirts of Brazil is for them not to be invisible.\n\nPrejudice and invisibility\n\nEven with initiatives such as the National Day of Roma Peoples, commemorated every May 24 since 2006, some rights are still neglected. For example, Romani people are not recognized in the national census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).\n\nSantos remembers the difficulty she faced in registering her children’s ethnic group in their identity documents. Since there is no official recognition of “Romani” ethnicity, she ended up registering them by their skin color.\n\n“There are policies catered to Indigenous peoples, Black and Brown people, but not for Romani people. We have our own culture, but we do not show up, which is why I say being Romani is being invisible,” she claims.\n\nRamanush experienced a similar situation when a census taker visited him during the most recent census in Brazil in 2022. “She asked me what my race was, and I answered that it was not on the list. My complexion is white, but I’m a Romani.”\n\nIBGE estimates that Brazil has between 800,000 and a million Romani, but the Roma groups believe the numbers are higher.\n\n“I've already travelled all over Brazil meeting Romani people from all ethnic groups. Without official data, there are no efficient public policies,” Ramanush explains. “Even to count how many Romani there are in each city or town, local governments make the process difficult.”\n\nBesides the lack of recognition, Romani people living in peripheral areas also face a prejudice that runs through generations. They have been accused of theft, robbery, and deception for centuries. It wasn’t rare to have them associated with kidnapping children.\n\nTrying to change this reality and fight prejudice, Romani groups have been mobilized for the approval of a bill making teaching Romani culture and history in schools mandatory — modeling what already happens with Black and Indigenous people in Brazil. The proposal presented by federal deputy Helder Salomão (PT, Workers’ Party), at the Chamber of Deputies as Bill 3547 of 2015, has made little progress.\n\nIn their justification, the text reinforces the idea that for centuries Romani groups have been experiencing prejudice, marginalization, exclusion and persecution. So, the bill aims to “change the image of Romani populations, trying to reduce prejudice and discrimination that these groups are subjected to.”\n\nThe bill also asserts that providing visibility for Romani groups “will provide a more fertile ground to build public policies focusing on the promotion of human rights.”",

    "title": "Cambodian and Thai activists unite to end hostility and promote peace over border disputes",
    "text": "This article was published by Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand. An edited version has been republished by Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement.\n\nBetween July and May 2025, tensions between Thailand and Cambodia over a border dispute devolved into violence that left at least 43 dead on both sides, dozens injured, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Despite signing a ceasefire agreement on July 28, hostility has remained deeply embedded in both countries, fueled by misinformation. Amidst the turmoil, Cambodians and Thais have come together to launch a cross-border campaign aimed at combating hatred and promoting empathy and lasting peace.\n\nThailand and Cambodia share over 700 kilometres of border, where several undemarcated sections have been long-standing sources of conflict between the two countries, since the Preah Vihear dispute beginning in the 1950s, to this year when clashes broke out on May 28th and led to fatalities on July 24th. On top of that, the countries also share historical and cultural ties, which have complicated the tensions between them, leading to deep-rooted hostility between the two peoples.\n\nHostility skyrocketed after the July 24 armed conflict as the conflict between the two governments trickled down to all facets of society. Cambodian and Thai netizens traded accusations on who initiated the clashes.\n\n“We see all the problems start to unfold, and when hatreds, prejudice, and discrimination on people’s level have gone online, it was even more devastating for us, and that's why we decided to come together on the Cambodian side to rally among ourselves,” said Lim Solinn, a Cambodian social activist and artist. She later reached out to friends in Thailand in different places and then stumbled upon a group of Thai people who are a network of solidarity.\n\nOu Tepphallin, a Cambodian labor rights activist and campaign co-organizer, said she joined the campaign to address the suffering of migrant workers and communities caught in the crossfire of recent tensions, particularly Cambodian workers in Thailand and Thai workers in Cambodia.\n\nThey faced physical violence and racism, and they were living with fear, so their voices were unheard. On top of that, children living along the border have lost opportunities to study due to the closure of border crossings. Family members were separated, such as a child whose mother was in Thailand but whose father was in Phnom Penh, and they have no idea when they can be reunited.\n\nIn addition, according to the Thai authorities, the conflict since July 24th has also caused over 500,000 Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand to return home, since most of them felt unsafe and threatened in Thailand. This has left Thailand with a significant labor shortage as Cambodian migrants typically played an essential role in the country's agricultural industry.\n\nSolinn stated that both Thai and Cambodian campaign organizers want the campaign to go viral in both countries and send messages to leaders saying, “Please don't use violence on Cambodian or Thai migrant workers.”\n\nThe campaigners are also trying to figure out catchy ways for this campaign to go viral and reach regular Thais and Cambodians. The campaign includes writing poems and making songs, which they believe could help calm people and encourage them not to hate simply because of what they heard or saw on the news.\n\n“We’re just starting, even if the war ends tomorrow, the hatred continues, so we need to continue this work and reach out to more communities in Cambodia and in Thailand,” said Solinn.\n\nPhallin added that it's time to heal those who suffered from both sides, and that is what the campaign did by starting to send healing messages to ordinary people.\n\nWhen hatred is louder than empathy\n\nIn Thailand, when the armed conflict erupted and innocent Thai civilians and military personnel were killed, many Thai netizens demanded tit for tat retaliation. In addition, right-wing influencers have threatened Cambodian migrant workers and called on patriots to use violence against them.\n\nOften, those who oppose this and call for a peaceful approach face condemnation online for being too optimistic or unpatriotic.\n\n“All the ordinary Cambodians want nothing but peace and harmony with our neighbours, and a lot of people get caught in between these polarizations, and because of the level of their vulnerability, they cannot get their voices heard at all,” noted Solinn.\n\nOn the Cambodian side, Solinn remarked that while they wanted peace and for this war to stop, most Cambodians also became enraged and emotional when they saw news about civilians being affected, schools being bombed, or news that many people were displaced.\n\nShe disclosed that since she and her friends launched the campaign, she has been harassed by netizens from both countries. For her, it has been difficult to get through to people how the hyper-nationalistic, violent narratives are spreading hate. Solinn said:\n\nThey have been misinformed and disinformed. They believe these sets of stories, and they have these perspectives, and it's hard to change. So, instead of trying to tell them a different version, we’re trying to appeal to their consciousness. We try to appeal to their empathy.\n\nEven though most of the information they received was not real, it was effective as it was coupled with prejudice, stereotyping, and hate speech amplified by social media. “It has added fuel to the fire of ultra nationalist perspectives. It just made it really hard for people to try to bridge across for people who are like us,” said Solinn.\n\nShe insisted that engaging with the same outrage and accusing each other of doing what each side thinks is wrong will not improve the situation, particularly for disputes that have been going on for hundreds of years, based on selective history from both sides.\n\nSolinn emphasized that it was time to put people’s lives first. Children should be able to return to school instead of living in refugee camps, families should be able to earn their livelihoods again, and both countries need to recognize the damage the conflict has inflicted on their economies.\n\nA call for peace: rebuilding trust and fostering empathy\n\n“We would like to urge the leaders to sit down and find a peaceful resolution and put the people first,” said Phallin. She also urged the leaders to negotiate and rebuild trust, insisting that peace can be achieved only by negotiation, not war.\n\nIn the meantime, Solinn urged the leaders to be compassionate and gentle and to reach a peaceful resolution, adding that a tremendous amount of strength is required. The campaign organizer also called on leaders on both sides to stop this war and allow everything to return to normal for the sake of the innocent people from both countries.\n\nShe suggested that Thailand and Cambodia stop promoting biases and stereotypes based on selective interpretations of history, particularly for the younger generations.\n\nSolinn also believes that when this war ends, Thais and Cambodians will come together to create mixed communities where people from both sides could share safe spaces and raise awareness of peace and harmony.\n\n“Educating in school or through the media wouldn't be enough. We need all the spaces, all the communities, we need a whole society to heal and to promote racial tolerance, peace, solidarity, and harmony,” said Phallin.\n\nIn terms of media, Solinn said media, particularly mainstream media, in both countries should not amplify hateful rhetoric, which has already been dominant on social media, but rather people’s stories, which would help promote reconciliation and peace, suggesting that selective parts of the history on both sides shouldn’t be allowed to frame the whole narrative about Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nShe noted that we did not know everything, but only heard different sides of the story. Each side believed the other started the war first or believed that the other side encroached upon their land.\n\n“Trust is so fragile. It's so easy to break, and it's broken already. It's very hard to rebuild, but we must try. We do not have a choice,” noted Solinn.",

    "title": "The judiciary’s dilemma: Protecting Nigeria’s whistleblowers without legislation",
    "text": "Nigeria’s whistleblower policy, introduced on December 21, 2016, was designed as a quick fix to expose systemic corruption. It promised whistleblowers between 2.5 and 5 percent of recovered looted public funds. However, while the policy incentivizes disclosures, it does not guarantee protection.\n\nInstead, whistleblowers often face surveillance, dismissal, or even death threats. Multiple attempts to pass a whistleblower protection bill over the years have stalled in Nigeria’s National Assembly, leaving whistleblowers legally vulnerable.\n\nNigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework\n\nOn September 18, 2025, Federal High Court judges and civil society advocates debated on Nigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework at a national interactive forum convened by the African Centre for Media & Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) for federal high court judges, in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city.\n\nHarry Ogwuche, the Director of Economic and Social Rights at Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), shared during the debate:\n\nProtecting whistleblowers is not an abstract anti-corruption strategy; it is a direct, proactive investment in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights as enshrined in Chapter IV of our Constitution and various international covenants Nigeria is party to.\n\nThe role of judges in protecting whistleblowers\n\nWhile seeking the support of judges in the advocacy for a whistleblower protection law in Nigeria, Chido Onumah, Coordinator of AFRICMIL, said:\n\nJudges are key actors in any judicial system. Therefore, the forum aims to provide a platform for interaction with judges on whistleblowing, its legal framework, and the critical role they play in ensuring justice for whistleblowers and handling corruption cases effectively.\n\nAt the forum, persecuted whistleblower Yisa Usman shared how he was pressured, intimidated, and sidelined from his profession after blowing the whistle on his company. Usman is a chartered accountant who worked in the finance and accounts department, but after exposing corruption, he was redeployed to the ICT department, transferred to different states, and subsequently fired. He said:\n\nBecause I decided to speak up, I am jobless. I was ostracized and frustrated to accept the norm. To remain silent is to be complicit. To achieve results as a whistleblower, it is important to be familiar with the laws because if you know the laws that guide and protect you, you will be able to challenge them. Despite several attempts to detain me, I am walking free because of the judiciary.\n\nExisting and pending laws to protect whistleblowers\n\nNigeria’s Constitution and several statutes already contain protections that could be extended to whistleblowers. These include: Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. Section 6(4)(c) of the National Human Rights Commission Act prohibits harassment of individuals who cooperate with the Commission. Anti-corruption laws like the EFCC Act and ICPC Act provide limited safeguards. The Freedom of Information Act protects disclosures made in good faith.\n\nIn practice, these fragmented provisions are inconsistently applied, and without a unified protection law, whistleblowers continue to face retaliation.\n\nNigeria’s situation contrasts sharply with that of its regional neighbors. Ghana’s Whistleblower Act (Act 720) and South Africa’s Protected Disclosures Act provide dedicated mechanisms.\n\nVladimir Radomirović, a Serbian journalist and co-founder of Pištaljka, an organization based in Belgrade that provides free legal aid and protection to whistleblowers, shared his experiences of building alliances with the judiciary to strengthen whistleblower protection in Serbia. He said:\n\nThe judges have a very influential role in protecting whistleblowers in Serbia, and we try to work with judges and allow them to hear from whistleblowers about how they are retaliated against for protecting the public interest.\n\nAFRICMIL and its partners urged the Nigerian legislature to urgently enact the whistleblower protection law, one that guarantees anonymity, provides penalties against retaliation, and establishes an independent body to oversee cases.\n\nWhistleblowers and civil society organizations appealed to judges to embrace a proactive role in safeguarding whistleblowers. They called for progressive adjudication that interprets existing laws in the spirit of transparency and protection for defenders; expedited hearings to ensure justice is not delayed and therefore denied; the awarding of exemplary damages against retaliators to serve as a deterrent; and above all, the protection of anonymity in court procedures. These recommendations, they argued, are vital if the judiciary is to strengthen trust, uphold justice, and ensure that whistleblowing truly serves as a tool for accountability in Nigeria.",

    "title": "Nepal’s Khoj Samachar challenges corruption and empowers youth through digital media",
    "text": "There are nearly 4,900 registered print media outlets in Nepal. Around eighteen news outlets operate exclusively online through digital platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. By law, online media must register with Nepal’s Department of Information and Broadcasting; however, not all outlets currently comply with this requirement.\n\nStanding out among these registered outlets is Khoj Samachar, an independent digital media platform that raises awareness among young people, challenges corruption, and amplifies underrepresented voices in Nepal. Its founder, Roshan Shrestha, is an investigative journalist from Nepal. His approach relies on digital platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and a dedicated app to draw public attention to marginalized stories and pressure authorities to take action. The platform publishes content in Nepali, in both text and video formats.\n\nAbdulrosheed Fadipe of Global Voices interviewed Roshan via WhatsApp to discuss his journey as an investigative journalist and how he uses digital platforms to promote social change, strengthen good governance, and encourage citizen engagement in Nepal.\n\nGlobal Voices (GV): What inspired you to start Khoj Samachar, and what challenges did you face in building it from scratch?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): I started my journalism journey during my school years at Shree Bachchhala Devi Higher Secondary School, Nagpuje, Sindhupalchok District, in Bagmati Province of Nepal. When I was in class 8, a man who was the presenter at Avenues Television came to my school to teach students about journalism. That training programme planted the seed of journalism in my mind.\n\nMy interest in journalism grew after a devastating earthquake occurred in Nepal in 2015. Although the epicenter of the earthquake was located in Gorkha district, many houses in my village, which is located near the Bhotekoshi River, were destroyed. Many people lost their lives. The Tataponi border crossing with China was also closed. I had just completed class 11 then. I was using a simple Android phone because I was from a low-middle-class family that depended on agriculture for a living. With that phone, I started filming and uploading videos of the earthquake's destruction of villages on a YouTube channel. This was how my journalism career began.\n\nIn 2021, I officially launched Khoj Samachar. I did not receive any financial support when I started nor did I have a big team. Now we have a team of four individuals broadcasting news in both English and Nepali.\n\nGV: How do you maintain editorial independence and ensure your outlet's content remains unbiased and free from external influences?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): We do not take money, favors, or support from any political party, business group, or outside donor. From day one, Khoj Samachar has survived only through the income we earn from Facebook and YouTube ads. With those limited earnings, we pay our team and run the entire platform. This is not always easy, but it gives us full freedom. Nobody can tell us what to say or what to hide. We can question leaders, expose corruption, and speak for the people without fear of losing sponsors or upsetting funders. Our only loyalty is to our readers and viewers. For us, independence is more valuable than comfort. Even if the road is difficult, we choose truth over compromise — that is why our content remains unbiased and trusted.\n\nGV: How do you prioritize stories that amplify underrepresented media voices, and what impact do you hope these stories have on your audience?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): At Khoj Samachar, we always give priority to the voices that big media often ignores — farmers, workers, rural youth, and ordinary citizens who face injustice. Many times, people from villages directly contact us to share their pain, because they feel unheard elsewhere.\n\nWe have highlighted stories like that of a person struggling to get a bridge built in his village, a road left unfinished for 10 years, or a family trapped in hardship without support. By showing these issues through videos, we try to bring public attention and pressure the authorities to act.\n\nOur hope is that by giving a platform to these underrepresented voices, young people will feel more connected, more aware, and inspired to raise their own voices. We want our audience to see that journalism is not only about leaders and cities, but also about the real struggles of common people — and that truth can bring real change.\n\nGV: What strategies do you use to reach audiences beyond capital cities, and how do you measure the impact of your reporting in these areas?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): From the beginning, our focus was not only on Kathmandu but also on rural and remote areas. We create stories that reflect the real problems of villages — like missing bridges in Humla, neglected roads in Dailekh, or migrant workers’ struggles. Many of these issues are sent to us directly by local people through phone calls, Facebook messages, or our app. By turning their voices into reports and videos, we make sure their problems are heard nationally.\n\nTo measure impact, we look at the response from citizens and authorities. For example, in Saudi Arabia, when stranded workers contacted us, our coverage led to parliamentary debates and direct government action. Similarly, when we cover local problems, we monitor community feedback in comments, shares, and messages, and also check if the government or local representatives respond. For us, the real impact is when ordinary people feel their voices are finally heard and some positive change begins.\n\nGV: What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced as an independent journalist, and how have you overcome them?\n\nRS: There have been many difficult moments in my journey, but the most painful ones came when some people, who are unable to accept the truth, started abusing my family and even threatened physical attacks in public. As a journalist, I can tolerate criticism and risk, but when my family is dragged into controversy for my work, it is truly unbearable.\n\nSpeaking the truth, especially against corruption and powerful figures, always brings political pressure. Many tried to silence us or scare us into stopping, but journalism loses its meaning if we compromise with fear. What keeps me going is the trust and support of the public and the inner courage to always speak the truth. The emotional burden is heavy, but I continue because ordinary people rely on us to be their voice, and that responsibility gives me the strength to move forward.\n\nGV: How do you envision the future of Khoj Samachar, and what steps are you taking to ensure its sustainability and continued impact?\n\nRS: My main goal is to build Khoj Samachar as a platform based only on truth and facts, not dependent on external funding or political power. The message I want to pass to youth is that they can succeed in journalism by standing for the truth, even if they are alone. I am working to add more features to the Roshan Shrestha App so that it will be useful for the public. This step will help us sustain our work, expand our impact, and keep serving society with independent journalism.\n\nGV: Why did you name the Roshan Shrestha App after yourself?\n\nRS: By putting my own name on the app, I wanted to assure users that this platform is genuine, transparent, and trustworthy. It is not for self-promotion but rather a matter of responsibility: if my name is attached, people know they can rely on it.",

But sharp cuts to foreign aid by a number of governments are shrinking the available funds for nonprofits, with digital rights organizations like ours taking a particular hit.\n\nAnd it’s a hard time for news and translation organizations right now, with new technologies being used to cut staff and mass-produced disinformation crowding out quality news. Even in this challenging time, Global Voices’ production and readership have been going up, but since we are committed to never paywalling and not showing ads, that doesn’t translate into covering our running costs unless readers donate.\n\nGlobal Voices is a relatively low-cost organization to run: we have no office, no rent, and few physical supplies. We pay for the servers that host our site and a few other administrative costs, but by far the majority of our expenses are for paying our staff. Many grants don’t want to fund more than a small percentage of personnel costs, because they want to pay directly for activities, but personnel costs are the basis of all our activities. Our staff and our volunteers research stories, write and edit, translate and advocate — and sometimes they also do graphic design or photo choice, social media promotion, and more. That is who we’re trying to support with the funds from this campaign — our community, the people who make the articles and essays, translations, research reports, and podcasts that you find on our site.\n\nIf we had a dollar for every page view of the site, we wouldn't need to do a campaign! And if each of those dollars were a monthly commitment, we’d be able to plan ahead for longer-term activities and be generally less stressed. But we know that not everyone can contribute for lots of different reasons, so instead we can think about it as five dollars from one-fifth of the monthly site visits, or ten dollars from one-tenth, and maybe someone who hasn't read anything this month but believes in what we do kicks in twenty-five bucks, and someone else who loves translations sends another fifteen and… you get the idea.\n\nWe hope that you can be one of those contributors, and if you can’t right now, we hope you still come and spend time on our site, and then tell other people about it. Even more than a news site, Global Voices is a community, and we’d like you to be a part of it.

    "title": "The paradox of women’s rights in Peru",
    "text": "By Grecia Flores Hinostroza\n\nIn Peru, women’s rights exist in a strange paradox: on paper, we have the laws, the representation, and the international commitments that promise equality; in reality, our lives tell a different story. Political progress coexists alongside persistent neglect, with numbers that flatter and figures that fail. This contradiction is not hidden in the shadows — the painful contrast is written plainly in the numbers we so proudly display.\n\nAccording to the SDG Gender Index, Peru scores 72.9 for “Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments,” a figure that suggests progress, visibility, and leadership. And yet, when we shift our gaze to health, the score drastically drops to 35.5, barely half. Women are present in Congress, but absent from the healthcare system that should protect them.\n\nIf political participation alone were enough, our streets would be safer, our hospitals accessible, and our voices heard beyond the voting booth. But in Peru, as in much of Latin America, representation has not broken the chains of inequality — it has simply made them less visible to those who govern.\n\nThe data tells one story. The lives of rural, Indigenous, and poor women tell another — one where access to basic sexual and reproductive health services is a distant reality. Where hospitals, experts, and care are unreachable. As the political scientist Stéphanie Rousseau notes in “The Politics of Reproductive Health in Peru,” “Although health sector reforms have had some positive impact on women’s reproductive health, the many restrictions placed on women’s right to reproductive choices have blocked further progress.”\n\nThe consequences are not abstract. In 2020, Peru’s maternal mortality ratio stood at 69 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the World Health Organization, far above the Latin American average of 45 and nearly five times that of Chile (16) and Uruguay (13). These numbers represent women whose lives could have been saved by timely care, safe births and the fulfilment of rights already recognized by law.\n\nBut these injustices are not only moral failures; they are legal betrayals. Peru has signed its name beneath international promises: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and others. These are not distant treaties gathering dust in diplomatic archives. They are binding commitments, written to safeguard the dignity, health, and safety of women — commitments meant to reach every hospital room, courtroom, and remote village in our country.\n\nLaws protecting sexual and reproductive health rights exist on paper, but they remain distant from the realities of rural, Indigenous, and poor women. Clinics lack essential services. Comprehensive reproductive care is unavailable. Legal frameworks declare equality, but equality disappears in places where women still face forced pregnancies, unsafe births, and systemic neglect.\n\nThe Constitution speaks of equality, but equality does not walk the roads where women carry their pregnancies alone. The Ministry of Health issues protocols, but those protocols do not save lives when the nearest health centre is closed, or when the only doctor is gone. Rights without access are hollow. Commitments without implementation are betrayal.\n\nIn this context, political representation must not be mistaken for liberation. We cannot accept the illusion of progress that comes from more women in office if it is not matched by concrete action to dismantle structural barriers. Empowerment is not an empty slogan — it is the lived reality without fear, accessing healthcare without barriers, and raising one’s voice without retaliation.\n\nThe gap between law and life is not an abstract policy flaw; it is a daily crisis. It is the young girl in a rural province forced to give birth after sexual assault because abortion is inaccessible. It is the mother who dies on the way to a hospital that never has the capacity to treat her. Likewise, it is the Indigenous community where reproductive rights exist only in the language of faraway courts, not in the practice of local healthy systems.\n\nIf we measure success only by the presence of women in power, we ignore the absence of justice in their communities. Numbers in parliament cannot compensate for empty maternity wards. International recognition cannot replace the right to safe childbirth.\n\nI call on the Peruvian Congress to legislate not for appearances, but for autonomy. To ensure that health, safety, and dignity are realities in every province. I call on international donors to fund the fight for reproductive freedom, not just political participation. And I call on Peruvian society to recognize that representation without rights is no victory at all.\n\nRepresentation matters. But it is only the beginning. Real empowerment is when every woman controls her future — her body, her health, her voice — regardless of where she was born or how far she lives from the capital. Until the day, the paradox will remain, and progress will be a promise half-kept.",

    "title": "Pro-government campaign against student protests attempts to justify repression in Serbia",
    "text": "This analysis by Nataša Stanojević was originally published by the International and Security Affairs Centre (ISAC), part of the regional initiative Western Balkans Anti-Disinformation Hub. An edited version is republished by Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nThe protest held on June 28 this year in Belgrade, on the Serbian national and religious holiday, Vidovdan, represented the culmination of months of public discontent with government policies and systemic societal problems.\n\nVidovdan is deeply rooted in national history and collective memory and has often been used as a symbol of political and moral struggle. In this case, students and other citizens chose the date to underscore the seriousness of their demands for responsible governance, to call for snap elections, and advocate for essential institutional reforms.\n\nAccording to estimates, the protest gathered around 140,000 people, making it one of the largest political gatherings in the past decade. The sheer size of the turnout reflects profound social frustration and a sense that institutional mechanisms for expressing discontent have completely failed. However, while the organizers’ demands were clearly defined — fighting corruption, institutional accountability, and democratization of the system — pro-government media constructed an entirely different picture.\n\nInstead of fact-based reporting, the public sphere was flooded with sensationalist headlines and claims aimed at delegitimizing the protests and criminalizing participants. The student movement and citizens were not portrayed as advocates of democratic values, but as a threat to the stability of the state. This strategy of criminalization, typical of authoritarian regimes, allowed the authorities to justify the use of force and intensified repression.\n\nPro-government media in Serbia systematically employ false and manipulative narratives to discredit legitimate civic protests and normalize the state’s repressive responses. Analysis shows that key propaganda tactics include labeling participants, manipulating events, constructing an image of a foreign enemy, and glorifying police force. These practices have long-term consequences for democratic processes and freedom of expression.\n\nInstruments of the propaganda narrative\n\nOne of the most commonly used strategies was the deployment of pejorative labels. Organizers and participants were not referred to as students or citizens but as “blockaders,” “hooligans,” and “terrorists.”\n\nA headline in the tabloid newspaper Informer, “Anti-hooligan operation in the city center: Watch how blockaders are arrested,” illustrates how police intervention was presented as necessary and legitimate, while citizens were criminalized. The term “terrorists” carries particularly strong connotations, suggesting extremism, even though the protests were peaceful in nature.\n\nMedia outlets widely circulated narratives about an alleged “hellish plan” by demonstrators. Headlines such as “Bridges and the entire city under siege: The new hellish plan of blockader terrorists, they want blood and dead bodies on the streets!” create an atmosphere of fear and suggest inevitable escalation into violence. These unfounded claims serve to mobilize the government’s loyal voter base and legitimize repressive measures. Rhetoric about “blood on the streets” and “danger to citizens” not only criminalizes protest participants but also frames them as a national security threat.\n\nPro-government discourse attributed goals to the protesters, such as “destroying the state” and “overthrowing the president.” These claims are not based on any documents or public statements by organizers, whose demands focused on improving safety, fighting corruption, and ensuring political accountability. Introducing accusations of “treason” and “collaboration with enemies” is part of a broader model of political propaganda in which social resistance is portrayed as a conspiracy against national interests.\n\nWhile pro-government media insisted on an image of violent demonstrations, actual events tell a different story. According to reports from independent media and human rights organizations, the majority of the protest was peaceful. This was also confirmed by the Council of Europe.\n\nThe few incidents that occurred happened only after police intervention, during which excessive force was used. The arrests or detentions of hundreds of people, along with documented cases of physical abuse, clearly show that state repression was the dominant dynamic. This gap between the media narrative and empirical facts is a classic example of the framing technique — selective presentation of reality to shape public opinion.\n\nThe broader political context and the foreign enemy narrative\n\nParticularly concerning is the strategy of linking the protests to alleged foreign enemies, in this case, Croatia. Certain tabloids and politicians suggested that the organizers of the protests were instruments in the hands of Croatian intelligence structures and that their goal was the destabilization of Serbia. These claims have no factual basis, but serve a clear propaganda purpose: to evoke historical tensions and use national stereotypes to create a sense of threat among citizens. (The hostilities between Serbia and Croatia have deep roots in their national narratives. These tensions began during the Ottoman Empire when many Serbian refugees were settled in Croatia by the Austrian authorities. The animosity intensified during World War II when Croatia joined the Axis powers, and was solidified during the wars that accompanied Yugoslavia’s breakup. This period culminated in Operation Storm, which resulted in the majority of Serbs fleeing Croatia.)\n\nThe use of Croatia in this narrative has a dual function: first, to mobilize patriotic sentiment; by suggesting that the protests are connected to a “hostile state,” the government reinforces its image as the defender of national interests. Second, it discredits the opposition and civic initiatives; by attributing “foreign influence” to the protests, the government delegitimizes their goals and diverts attention from internal problems such as corruption and institutional breakdown. This rhetoric relies on the well-known model of “constructing a foreign enemy,” which, according to political communication theory, serves to homogenize the electorate and justify authoritarian practices.\n\nA particularly alarming segment of the propaganda campaign concerns the linkage of protests with the issue of Srebrenica. (The 1995 massacre of the Muslim population in Srebrenica and its surrounding areas by the Army of Republika Srpska is frequently exploited by both nationalist and anti-Western factions in Serbia. Similar to narratives that deny the Holocaust, discussions about Srebrenica range from complete denial to unsettling debates about the number of victims, their nationality, and the use of terms like “necessary military action” and “collateral damage.” Over the past 15 years, anyone who does not support these narratives has been labeled a “traitor” or a “Western agent” in official political discourse.)\n\nIn an Informer article entitled “They’ve exposed themselves! This is blockader politics: Accusing Serbia of a nonexistent genocide in Srebrenica,” students were accused of “agreeing with accusations that brand Serbs as a genocidal nation.” This narrative attempts to shift the focus from demands for democratization to a national question, creating the impression that the protests have an “anti-Serbian agenda.” In this way, civic resistance is criminalized through manipulation of one of the most emotionally charged issues in the public sphere.\n\nA similar rhetoric is used by the portal Vaseljenska in the article “Blockaders want to declare Serbs a genocidal nation: Elections, then a government that will recognize the genocide in Srebrenica.” These claims are absent from any official demands of the organizers, but their function is clear: to discredit the protests by linking them with alleged plans to “betray national interests.” Thus, the government constructs a narrative in which students are not only “hooligans” but also agents of dangerous ideological and political projects.\n\nNarrative vs objective facts\n\nIn the long term, such practices lead to the consolidation of authoritarian patterns of governance. When every criticism of regime representatives is labeled as “treason” or “terrorism,” the space for democratic dialogue disappears. This not only delegitimizes protests but also undermines the fundamental values on which modern democratic societies rest.\n\nThis analysis of the media narrative surrounding the Vidovdan protests demonstrates that pro-government media act as a propaganda apparatus whose primary function is the preservation of political power, not informing the public. Through the dissemination of a distorted perception of civic resistance, the construction of violent scenarios, and the invention of foreign enemies, the authorities succeed in delegitimizing valid social demands and justifying repressive measures. Such a strategy may stabilize the regime in the short term, but in the long run, it erodes the foundations of democracy and leads to further political and social crises.",

    "text": "This Dart Centre Asia Pacific Report by Arun Karki was originally published in Nepali Times, and an edited version has been republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.\n\nWhat should a journalist do when young protesters are shot in front of her? Does she do her job and stay neutral? Can you stay neutral?\n\nAs Gen Z protests engulfed Kathmandu, Nepal's journalists found themselves reporting a story that was personal. While doing their job, some of them were even targeted by mobs.\n\nRead More: Gen Z stands up to expose corruption in Nepal\n\nDart Asia Pacific Fellow Arun Karki visited their newsrooms and spoke with his colleagues about their experience of reporting the Gen Z protests that erupted on September 8th. These are the first-hand accounts of journalists who witnessed the turmoil in the city they call home.\n\nSunita Karki was at a workshop in a hotel on September 8th. She saw the first waves of protests through hotel windows. Curfew alerts flooded her phone, a vehicle belonging to a human rights group sat burning across the road, young boys were taking their wounded friends on motorbikes to local hospitals, and police were beating a teenager with their hands raised.\n\n“I cried a lot,” she said, but the tears were not out of fear — they were because she felt guilt. “I couldn’t write the news. We were witnessing these scenes from a five-star hotel.” By evening, the death toll had reached 19. On September 9th at about 3:35 pm, her outlet, the Annapurna Post's office in Tinkune, Kathmandu, was set on fire. Staff had to leave the building as parts of the newsroom burned down.\n\nWhen she knew her office was burning, she anxiously told her husband that she would resign from the job: “If we have to hide our identification cards in every protest, what kind of journalist am I?” she asked herself.\n\nShe filed a story the next day, but her emotions kept bouncing between those of a journalist bound to duty and a civilian in shock. She said that in moments like this, it’s hard to feel truly neutral.\n\nAfter watching the police beat people, she felt a strong urge to step in, not just stand back and report. The first real calm came later, when people came to the street and lit candles together in honor of those who were killed. “This was a sort of victory procession. I felt some relief after brutal days,” she said.\n\nAngad Dhakal a photojournalist who works at Kantipur National Daily, was standing outside his office building when protesters stormed in and set parts of it on fire. He had already been informed that protesters were planning to torch his office building and rushed to his office hoping to save his hard drives containing ten years of photography work. He failed.\n\nHe raised his camera and “forcefully” pressed the shutter — more to document the scene than out of “professional enthusiasm or duty.”\n\n“My office was burning. What should I photograph?” he recalled. A few moments later, a protester noticed the “PHOTO” label on his yellow Press jacket. Dhakal deflected it by saying he was an early-career freelancer and YouTuber. He went into a corner and took his jacket off so that protesters wouldn't target him.\n\nWhen it comes to covering street protests, Angad usually stands near the police because it feels safer. But on September 8th, fire and gunshots made even that area unsafe. A rubber bullet hit his friend Dipendra Dhungana, badly injuring him.\n\nHe thought, “Where do we go now? If we stay here, we’ll be hit.” After witnessing two days of protests, violence, and killings, and seeing his own office burning, he couldn't sleep for days.\n\nThe same afternoon that government buildings burned and media outlet Kantipur was attacked, a message in a protest Discord forum talked openly of “attacking Kantipur.”\n\nRumors spread to other outlets. Outside OnlineKhabar's office, where Gaurav Pokharel works, the newsroom manager said, “Very suspicious people were walking around.” They lowered blinds, avoided windows, locked the front gate, and dispersed staff to other places across the city. The outlet was threatened and effectively locked down, but not torched.\n\nPokharel hid his press ID. “ I never showed the ID card. Sometimes I had to enter the crowd shouting slogans, just to blend in among the protesters,” he said. He watched people fall under gunfire, and he helped pull one surrounded journalist out of a hostile crowd.\n\nGaurav also contributed articles to international outlets as a freelancer. Later, while transcribing an interview of a young protest organizer, he wrote to his editor at an international outlet: “This was very hard to write. I cried many times while doing it.” He had been working at a stretch for days, battling bouts of exhaustion and low blood pressure.\n\nProtesters vandalized and set fire within the Singha Darbar complex housing Nepal Television and Radio Nepal. They tried to disrupt public broadcasting.\n\nSurendra Paudyal began the day with his press ID hanging on his neck, thinking it would let him move freely. But when he reached Singha Darbar around 3:30 pm, the situation felt dangerous.\n\nHe put the ID in his pocket. When asked what mattered most, he answered without pause: life comes first. In that moment, he felt real fear and a strong duty to protect his team.\n\nHis focus narrowed to basic things: stay calm, find exits, get everyone out safely. Later, they were able to keep the 8 pm news on air through a regional link. He felt mixed emotions and a sense of relief that the broadcast continued, but also sadness and anger that their own studio had come under attack.",

    "title": "The great silence surrounding marital rape in Senegal",
    "text": "By Bowel Diop\n\nGender-based violence, including marital rape, occurs worldwide, and often, the perpetrators are the victim's husband. Marital rape is defined as an act in which one partner forces the other to engage in non-consensual sex. A report by Equality, a US-based organisation with offices in New York, Nairobi, and London, reveals that many women are affected by this phenomenon, including many in Africa.\n\nIn private online forums where women post under anonymity, distressing testimonies emerge about the violence they suffer within relationships. Out of respect and for the protection of those sharing their stories, no names or platform details are revealed. Behind these testimonies emerges a chilling reality: that of sexual relations imposed within marriage without the woman’s consent, in other words, the reality of marital rape.\n\nAs violence against women becomes increasingly common, consent is being trampled. The notion of “conjugal duty” still frequently outweighs a woman’s right to make decisions about her body.\n\nIt is in these digital spaces, where distress is voiced and violence normalized, that discussion groups take shape, embodying a form of digital sisterhood. Providing room for listening, support, and open speech, these spaces enable women to challenge together the taboos that restrict their empowerment, online as well as offline. This safe space where women share their experiences underlines the urgency of an open and courageous debate on marital rape in Africa.\n\nA cultural, religious, and legal debate\n\nIn May 2025, the program “Midi Plus” on TFM Télévision Futur Média, based in Senegal, gave national exposure to Oustaz Modou Fall, a Muslim authority in the country. This preacher claims that conjugal duty takes precedence over consent, thereby legitimizing sexual violence in the name of marriage. Speaking in Wolof, he stated:\n\nGnouni loi bi néna sakh sa diabar so beugué teud akk mom té dacoroul daga ko violé . Pfff wakhi dof ! Sa diabar ga takk ko so farata Yallah akk souna Seydouna Mohamed , touki Pape Samba dem tournage soneu baye beugu dé gnibissi beugu teud ak sokhname gnouniko bouné dama soneu damadone fobéré (rires) ga forcéko viol le. Boudé lou amm la , lane moye texte bi. Si diné.\n\nPeople say the law declares that if you force your wife to have sex, that counts as rape. Pfff — absurd, this is your wife, the one you married before God. You travel, you work, Pape Samba [the host], you come back exhausted, you want to be with your wife, and she refuses. She says she’s tired, that she was doing the housework (laughter). So if you insist, it’s rape? If that’s the case, which religious scripture says so? We must be cautious about this.\n\nThe broadcast immediately sparked indignation across social media. On TikTok, activists and legal experts mobilized. The Xam Sa Droit page published a series of videos challenging Modou Fall’s statements against existing legislation. Specifically, it points to Article 320 of Senegal’s Penal Code, which defines rape as any act of penetration “carried out through violence, coercion, threat or surprise.” This is a reminder that marriage does not take away any fundamental rights, and that refusing sex, even within a couple, remains an inalienable right. This effort at legal education was met with strong support on TikTok, as it put consent back at the center of the discussion.\n\nVoices were also raised on X. Nabou Diop Lo, a lawyer and activist for women’s and children’s rights, posted:\n\nLe viol tel que définit dans le code pénal Sénégalais ne fait pas une distinction entre le viol commis dans le ménage et celui commis hors des liens conjugaux. Tout ce qui compte c'est le consentement de la victime. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nRape, as defined in the Senegalese Penal Code, makes no distinction between rape committed within marriage and that committed outside it. What matters is the victim’s consent. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nBut how can a woman dare complain she's been raped when a religious figure claims that a wife’s “no” carries no weight? This dissonance between the law, public discourse, and women’s lived reality highlights the urgent need for legal reform and a clear stance from the authorities.\n\nBy normalizing marital rape, this official rhetoric entrenches an absolute claim over women’s bodies and heavily compounds the moral weight borne by potential victims.\n\nEquality Now’s 2024 report shows that the legal recognition of marital rape differs significantly across Africa. The report notes that countries such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Madagascar, Senegal, and Togo explicitly criminalize marital rape.\n\nIn countries including Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Tanzania, spouses are explicitly exempted from prosecution, except in exceptional cases.\n\nIn Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mali, Uganda, and Chad, the law remains silent on the matter, creating a complete legal void.\n\nSenegalese law on rape and paedophilia, revised in 2020, sets out the definition of rape as follows:\n\nTout acte de pénétration « commis par violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise ».\n\nAny act of penetration ‘committed by violence, coercion, threat, or surprise.’\n\nHowever, the lack of clear legal provisions on marital rape and spousal consent creates a wide scope for interpretation, often to the detriment of the victim. As a result, marital rape is often treated as an ordinary form of domestic violence, rather than classified as a criminal offence.\n\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, for example, an investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde published in February 2024 reported that a humorous TikTok video mocking women’s sexual fatigue sparked amused reactions — evidence that sexual non-consent is not taken seriously.\n\nAccording to figures published in African Health Sciences, 33 percent of women in Africa have been subjected to sexual violence at some point in their lives, with rates rising to 44 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Côte d’Ivoire, 40 percent of women housed in the shelter run by the NGO Akwaba Mousso say they have suffered marital rape.\n\nIn many African legal systems, including in Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, the implicit presumption of consent between spouses prevents marital rape from being effectively recognised as a crime.\n\nWhen feminists raise awareness on the subject, the issue is frequently minimised. In the previously mentioned Le Monde article, Ivorian activist Marie-Paule Okri, co-founder of the Ivorian League for Women’s Rights, told the journalist:\n\nQuand on essaie d’en parler, on nous répond qu’on exagère. On nous inculque depuis l’adolescence que le corps de la femme est fait pour donner du plaisir à l’homme.\n\nWhen we try to talk about it, we are told we are exaggerating. From adolescence, we are taught that a woman’s body exists to give pleasure to men.\n\nYet Article 14 of the Maputo Protocol commits African states to guaranteeing women’s fundamental rights, including health and reproductive consent.\n\nBeyond legislation, it will take a deep change in attitudes to improve women’s condition, grounded in respect for their bodies and equality in relationships.",

    "text": "On October 7, 2023, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), the group that governs the Palestinian territory of Gaza, breached the barrier that has surrounded the densely populated area for the last 16 years, preventing the free flow of people and goods. The militants then launched an attack on 22 nearby Israeli settlements, towns, and military bases, killing around 1,200 civilians and soldiers and taking at least 199 hostages.\n\nMany governments around the world have condemned the attack as a war crime and act of terror, while other governments blamed Israel for setting the stage for these attacks to take place. Since then, many governments have described Israel’s response as disproportionate: the official death toll now exceeds 40,000 Palestinians killed, including over 15,000 children — some experts estimate the actual number to be over four times higher.\n\nFor more, read Global Voices’ previous Special Coverage: Israel’s war on Gaza\n\nThe assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas Political Bureau, in Tehran on 31 July 2024, and a key Hezbollah military commander in Beirut on 30 July have significantly escalated tensions in the region. These targeted killings, combined with the failure to implement a ceasefire, are raising the risk of a war that could engulf the whole region, with potentially far-reaching consequences for global peace and stability.\n\nIsrael’s actions, including its military occupation, settlement expansion, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and recurrent operations in Gaza and the West Bank, have drawn widespread accusations of human rights violations and defiance of international law. This includes an International Court of Justice (ICJ) initial ruling on an ongoing case finding it plausible that Israel is committing genocide and an application by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for arrest warrants against three Hamas leaders — including Haniyeh — and two Israeli officials — including Prime Minister Netanyahu — for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe arrest warrants include one for Mohammed Deif, Commander-in-Chief of Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. the Israeli army claims to have assassinated Deif in an airstrike on July 13 in the Al Mawasi humanitarian safe zone in Gaza — one that killed at least 90 people in a massacre described by United Nations official Scott Anderson as “some of the most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.”\n\nIsrael's military operations and targeted assassinations in neighboring countries continue despite United Nations Security Council resolutions, global calls for a ceasefire, and repeated condemnations from international humanitarian organizations who have labeled them as violations of international humanitarian law. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached catastrophic levels, with an illegal blockade that has led to severe shortages of vital supplies and the threat of a poliovirus outbreak, exacerbating the suffering of the population, with nine out of 10 people internally displaced, many of them multiple times.\n\nThe international community’s failure to enforce a ceasefire or hold Israel accountable has highlighted the limitations of global institutions in managing the crises. The United Nations has failed to mediate effectively, with its resolutions ignored, and global and regional players have not put pressure on Israel to accept or implement ceasefire resolutions adopted by the UNSC or proposed by mediators. This raises significant questions about the effectiveness of international law in protecting civilians in conflict zones.\n\nIn this special coverage, we explore the regional and global implications as well as the challenges facing international law in addressing the ongoing crisis.",

    "title": "How one community in Trinidad & Tobago pushed the culinary boundaries of pigeon peas",
    "text": "By Natalie Briggs\n\nWhen I first met Florence Warrick-Joseph, there were two things I didn’t know. One, we were related in that pumpkin vine way only Caribbean people can be. Two, the doubles I had just bought from her at a pop-up market had a surprise in them.\n\nIt wasn’t the comforting warmth of a bara hot out of the box, leaking through greaseproof paper. It wasn’t the silken tear of teeth into that just-fried pillowy goodness, which, if you’re lucky, will still hold a hint of the crackle of oil.\n\nNo, it wasn’t that.\n\nIt was the filling. Cucumber, check. Sweet sauce, check. The heady bouquet of garlic, cumin and spices was there. But there was something different in the mouth feel. It wasn’t the melt-in-your-mouth consistency of the channa that makes doubles a national byword in Trinidad and Tobago. Tasty, yes … but different.\n\nThe same bouquet is heavy in Warrick-Joseph’s small kitchen, tickling the nostrils, making me think about the last time I ate. “I don’t curry the peas. I stew it,” she revealed, while demonstrating how she puts her spin on the popular street food. This is not her only departure from the norm. The peas she uses? They are pigeon peas.\n\nThese days, it isn’t quite the record scratch moment it was when it first appeared — but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. What we should be discussing is how pigeon peas, the stuff of pelau and coconut milk stew-downs, ended up in doubles. It started as an exhortation to think outside the box.\n\nIn 2014, Warrick-Joseph, a retired registered nurse, decided to do an event management course. Her lecturer asked the cohort to stretch themselves beyond the ho-hummery of birthday parties and christenings for their practicum. She was an avid planter of pigeon peas, one of the many members of the Upper Cemetery Street Residents’ Association in Diego Martin, to do so. They had a bumper crop that year.\n\n“We were walking back down the hill,” Warrick-Joseph recalled. “Me, Errol [her husband] and Mr. Timothy. And he asked what were we going to do with all these peas. My husband said, ‘We will freeze it, we will sell it.’ Because that is what people do to get money to put in the organisation. So I said, thinking out of the box, we could have a pigeon peas festival.”\n\nThe two men were sceptical. Warrick-Joseph continued, “They were like, ‘Nobody ever heard of a pigeon peas festival.’ I said, ‘I’ve heard of a mango festival. I’ve heard of a breadfruit festival. There’s a chocolate festival. Why not pigeon peas?’”\n\nThe stage was set, but the main players were yet to arrive. They had the peas, but it would literally take a village to showcase their versatility. By the time the first festival rolled around in 2015, it was a result of a true community effort. They were able to generate so many recipes, including a version of doubles, that there were enough to fill a commemorative book.\n\n“We got someone to do pholourie,” Warrick-Joseph said. “We got somebody who could do pigeon peas accra. Everybody ended up taking a recipe. We found people in the community who could do these things. The pigeon peas roti was from a woman who did roti, and instead of using the dhal with the split peas, she used the pigeon peas.”\n\nPholourie? Accra? Roti? It wasn’t such a stretch of the imagination. After all, pigeon peas’ nutty, earthy flavour lends itself well to a variety of savoury preparations. That’s why it’s a perennial favourite across the Caribbean.\n\nBut Warrick-Joseph was about to hit me another curveball. That first festival, she came up with four of her own recipes. One for ice cream. One for a punch. One for a pigeon peas wine. Then one for a liqueur. Two of those are sweet. One of them officially qualifies as dessert. The trick was in picking, shelling and stewing the fresh pigeon peas to form the custard base all within 24 hours, while they were still full of flavour. My mind had more difficulty wrapping around the idea of pigeon peas as this creamy, cold concoction.\n\nThere were no such problems with the muffins. As I stood and watched her prepare them, different scents filled the kitchen, this time with her signature spice blend. It was the spice, I realised, that gave it the illusion of being sweet. I hadn’t seen her put a lot of sugar into the mixture. The eventual result was dense, reminding me more of a coconut drop than the traditional muffin with its cakey crumb. Fresh out of the oven, breaking into one was a treat; I could smell the spices wafting up from the steamy centre. There was nutmeg. Some cinnamon, too.\n\nNothing in the flavour screamed pigeon peas. That was more in the texture and the solidity with which it sat in my stomach. One muffin felt like a full meal, which led me to ask about the nutritional benefits of the pigeon peas substitution. I found out that, among other things, they were high in potassium and fibre, and were good for gut flora, diabetics, and women who wanted to lose weight.\n\nIn fact, it was trying to cater to customers who wanted healthier alternatives to doubles that prompted Warrick-Joseph to come up with a recipe for gluten-free bara, made with pigeon pea flour: “The reason for the switch was that people felt they wanted gluten-free. There was a group of people that was intolerant to normal flour.”\n\nThese were what I had really come to see her prepare, the muffins being a delectable side journey. I knew it would be different from the first doubles I had from her, since the bara in that one had been made the regular way, with flour, leavening agent and oil. How different this version would be, both in taste and feel, was left to be seen.\n\nIt was a three-flour mix, including the ground pigeon peas, which resulted in a tacky, sticky sort of dough that was allowed to rest for about half an hour. While it did that, Warrick-Joseph warmed the oil in which she would fry them later, and prepared the pigeon peas filling. We talked about many things while she did this, including her business and her plans to eventually have pre-packaged products in the supermarket.\n\nWhen she deemed the dough ready, she put the peas aside. The low gluten content made it difficult to handle as it tears easily, which is why she prefers to use a pastelle press to shape them, instead of rolling them out the traditional way. From there, the perfect circles went into the warmed oil, where they puff up slightly — nothing like the regular bara, because of the low gluten content. By the time they are done, I’m itching to try them.\n\nWarrick-Joseph presented them to me on a plate, complete with pigeon peas filling, cucumber and a tangy tamarind sweet sauce. I took a bite, and chewed slowly, trying to make up my mind about them. The verdict? All the elements were there. This tasted like doubles. Purists might draw the line at the bara, which was more reminiscent of a soft taco shell — flatter, with a slight, mealy crunch to it — while health enthusiasts might hail it as the thing to make doubles great again.",

    "title": "Meet Esther, an independent journalist reporting from the frontlines of Myanmar",
    "text": "Exile Hub is one of Global Voices’ partners in Southeast Asia, emerging in response to the 2021 coup in Myanmar, focusing on empowering journalists and human rights defenders. This edited article is republished under a content partnership agreement.\n\nMost people spend their lives running away from danger. Esther ran toward it.\n\nAfter finding refuge in Australia under UNHCR protection, she made the bold decision to return to the Thailand–Myanmar border in 2023 to continue her journalism. Now, in 2025, she reports from one of Myanmar’s most dangerous conflict zones often under fire, often uncertain of tomorrow. Yet she remains unshaken.\n\nIn a world where silence is safe, Esther chooses the frontline. Her weapon is truth, and she wields it for those who cannot.\n\nA journey against the current\n\nBorn in Mon State in 1993, Esther has always been someone who could not ignore injustice.\n\n“I have never been able to lie to myself or live in misery. If something doesn’t sit right with me, I have to face it head-on,” she reflects.\n\nLike many young people in Myanmar, Esther initially wandered through different jobs, unsure of her calling. She translated movies, worked as a travel and tour sales representative, and later became a public relations officer at a Korean company. But none of these roles felt right.\n\n“I couldn’t stay where I felt trapped or compromised,” she shares.\n\nHer turning point came in 2018 when she attended a basic journalism course. “That’s when I realized writing and sharing opinions was what I had always loved. It felt like home.” After the course ended, she landed her first journalism job at an ethnic media house.\n\nWhen the coup changed everything\n\nBy 2021, Esther was working with a major media house. When the coup hit, her newsroom relocated to Karenni State, and Esther went with them, continuing to report under dangerous conditions. But even after escaping to Australia for safety, the pull of truth was stronger than comfort. In 2023, she made the decision to return.\n\nA few months after she arrived in Thailand, the military made a desperate announcement. In February 2024, the military reactivated its conscription law, mandating that men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 serve in the army. Evading service or helping someone evade could lead to five years in prison.\n\n“As the number of these conscription stories grew, so did my determination to report them,” Esther recalls. But working as an exiled independent journalist came with its own struggles. With no regular income and the constant need for resources, continuing her work was a challenge. That’s when she applied for Exile Hub’s Critical Voices Fellowship 2024 and received it.\n\nBearing witness on the frontlines\n\nEsther began collecting stories from those most affected. She spoke with young men who had fled their villages, fearful of being conscripted. She also interviewed women who had watched brothers and husbands taken by the army, leaving families uncertain and anxious about their loved ones’ fate.\n\nIn September 2024, she published “I Don’t Want Others to Face What I Faced: Stories of Forced Military Conscription,” giving a voice to those the regime wanted silenced.\n\nLater, she followed with another hard-hitting piece, “Snatched from Their Beds, Taken on the Streets — The Young Men in Myanmar Forced to Fight the Junta’s Losing War.”\n\nToday, Esther works deep inside one of Myanmar’s most volatile conflict zones, a place where the sound of gunfire and the threat of airstrikes are constant. Despite the risks, she is satisfied with witnessing the truth with her eyes and documenting and reporting on it.\n\nEsther is more than a journalist. She is a lifeline for those whose cries would otherwise vanish in the dark. And no matter the risk, she will keep writing and keep reporting, because for her, silence is never an option.",

    "text": "Environmental groups initiated global activities and protests from September 18 to 21 to drumbeat the call for urgent climate action amid the worsening pollution and continuing deterioration of the natural ecosystem. The series of protests were held right before the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and less than six weeks away from the UN Climate Summit (COP30) in Brazil.\n\nIn Asia, the “Draw the Line” campaign highlighted the demand to phase out fossil fuels, build renewables, shift to sustainable food, and prioritize the people’s basic needs over corporate interests.\n\nSeveral countries participated in the campaign led by a network of environmental groups and community-based organizations.\n\nIn the Philippines, the campaign was actively supported by local groups resisting projects and policies that threaten the lives and livelihoods of rural and coastal communities. A fluvial protest was organized in the town of Culasi in Antique province, located in the Visayas islands of the Philippines, to call attention to the demand of the small fisherfolk against the entry of commercial fishing operations in municipal waters. Javie Barcinal of 350.org Asia echoed the stand of small fishers.\n\nSmall fishers are among the worst affected by the climate crisis, with warming seas resulting in dwindling catches each year. To make matters worse, the government has allowed industrial fishing to encroach into municipal waters. This exacerbates climate injustice that small fishers experience as hunger for their families.\n\nIn Indonesia, environmnetalists organized at least 36 actions in 34 cities and provinces across the country on September 18, to push for bold reforms in government policies. A march was held towards the State Palace on September 19 as rallyists reiterated the anti-corruption demands of the youth-led protests that erupted in the country last month. Sisilia Nurmala Dewi of 350.org Indonesia led climate advocates in asserting an end to corruption to fund a better future.\n\nWe draw the line as flash floods drown the innocent, while people’s voices against government failures are being silenced. Oligarchs and polluters have ruled this country for far too long, taking public money for climate action and destroying natural resources that should be preserved for future generations. We demand real, decisive action. President Prabowo must honor his promises by committing to 100 percent renewable energy in 10 years and a clear immediate plan to phase-out coal plants.\n\nPaskah Toga of Climate Rangers Bali cited the recent flooding disaster in Bali island to rally public opposition against fossil-based power plants.\n\nThe recent deadly floods in Bali is clear evidence that the climate crisis is no longer a distant threat but a reality that needs to be resolved with concrete policies. The government must stop building fossil-based power plants and phase out fossil fuels.\n\nIn Japan, protesters challenged the new leadership to phase out fossil fuels and to reverse policies that blame immigrants for the country’s social woes. Masayoshi Iyoda, 350.org Japan campaigner, summed up their demand.\n\nWe draw the line on Japan’s rising contributions to climate chaos and war. As we experience both flash floods and extreme heat, workers suffer and food prices continue to soar. Japan’s new leadership must show political will to phase out fossil fuels and shift to 100% renewables, instead of going with the far-right tide of blaming immigrants for our economic woes and backsliding on climate action.\n\nThe protest was also attended by activists who expressed solidarity with Palestinians by condemning the continuous bombings and military attacks in Gaza.\n\nIn South Korea, Jiyun Gim of the Green Environment Youth Korea urged authorities to comply with the planned emissions reduction this year.\n\nSouth Korea’s 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) will be determined in November. We are drawing the line to prevent South Korea from setting a climate goal that falls below 60% emissions reduction. This is not just about numbers—it is the survival line for future generations. The government must set ambitious, science-based, and future-oriented climate targets.\n\nIn Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh, community residents staged an action denouncing the planned revival of a coal plant. Shahrukh Karim, a youth leader in Matarbari, articulated the sentiments of the local community.\n\nWe are burning, our lands are dying, and our rivers are drying up. We draw the line on building another coal plant, when the existing one has already driven away thousands of families and turned our homes into a wasteland. This needs to stop.\n\nCommunities Draw the Line on Matarbari Coal Plant 2 Revival https://t.co/2IT1VPkF5P pic.twitter.com/9E05xBK9xV — Energy & Power (@enpbd) September 20, 2025\n\nIn an email interview with Global Voices, 350.org Asia Communications Manager Ilang-Ilang Quijano shared their initial plans on how to sustain the campaign.",

    "title": "Africa charts bold path towards green inclusive development at the second Africa Climate Summit",
    "text": "Over 6,000 delegates gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, for the second Africa Climate Summit (ACS2), held from September 8 to 10, to search for Africa-driven solutions ahead of negotiations for the United Nations 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the world's largest annual environmental conference.\n\nThe second Africa Climate Summit was organized to unite African leaders, youth, and partners in pushing for fair climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s role as a solutions hub, while preparing a common position ahead of COP30 negotiations. It was a pivotal moment for Africa to stake its claim as a leader in the global climate conversation. Leaders, activists, and young innovators came together to push for reforms in climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s youth voices. The gathering was themed around “Accelerating Global Climate Solutions: Financing for Africa’s Resilient and Green Development.” Ethiopia’s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, opened the event with a keynote that set the tone:\n\nAfrica should not be seen only as a victim of climate challenges, but as a continent of solutions and innovations that could guide the world forward.\n\nHe also proposed the “Africa Climate Innovation Compact” to produce 1,000 innovators by 2030, financed and owned by Africans.\n\nThis vision was built on the momentum of the inaugural summit in Nairobi in 2023, which, importantly, was preceded by the African Youth Climate Assembly (AYCA). By doing so, organizers ensured that the majority-youth population of Africa was not just represented but central to shaping the conversation.\n\nThe challenges Africa faces\n\nAfrica continues to wrestle with the painful legacy of historical injustice and the harsh reality of a deepening climate crisis. Despite contributing the least to global emissions, the continent feels the impacts most acutely. Climate finance remains painfully inadequate as wealthy nations have consistently fallen short of their yearly pledge, and African countries today pay back about five times more in debt servicing than they receive in climate aid.\n\nThe cost of this imbalance is causing hospitals to stretch beyond capacity as diseases like malaria and cholera spread more widely under shifting climatic conditions. Crops are failing under the weight of prolonged droughts or sudden floods, leaving farmers with empty fields and families without food. Coastal cities, from Lagos to Dar es Salaam, face rising waters that sweep away homes, businesses, and livelihoods.\n\nYet at the same time, Africa holds some of the richest renewable resources on the planet. If harnessed, its solar capacity alone could power the world many times over. Africa holds 17 percent of the world’s population but receives just 3 percent of global climate investment. Restrictive financial systems and predatory loan arrangements often force African countries back into reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nEcoVista, a youth-led ecological justice movement whose main focus is on climate justice and the environment, based in Nairobi, Kenya posted on its X account:\n\nFossil fuels are the biggest driver of the climate crisis, responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. #MakeThemPay\n\nDraw The Line pic.twitter.com/N9aUDWl8e8 — EcoVistaKe (@EcoVistaKE) September 19, 2025\n\nLayered on top of that is a painful reminder of colonial history. While Africa’s minerals powered industrial growth in the Global North, the continent was left behind with ecological damage and struggling economies. Yearly natural disasters including cyclones, floods, and expanding deserts displace millions every year, and pushed African leaders at ACS2 to adopt the Addis Ababa Declaration, a clear and urgent call for change.\n\nWith regard to the consequences facing Africa, Tangwa Abilu, a Cameroonian Climate and Environmental Activist, shared on X :\n\nThe horn of Africa is grieving because their\n\n-Their farms are no longer yielding\n\n-Advancement of desert is alarming\n\n-Our major rivers are drying\n\n-Proliferation of pest and pathogens\n\n-Development of tropical diseases.\n\n-Our crop are dieing out.\n\nClimate change is a reality. pic.twitter.com/2MQ5fZG1Zo — Tangwa Abilu.🌿🌏🌾🍀🍃.SDG's. (@AbiluTangwa) December 29, 2024\n\nIn the same context, K. Diallo, an African author, drew attention to the damage caused by floods in December 2023. He posted on his X account:\n\nflood disaster in the DR Congo is a result of global warming meeting a failed state…..The global South bears more than 95% of the costs and deaths related to climate change despite making up less than 5% of consumption-based cumulative emissions above 350ppm CO2. pic.twitter.com/vTDobNNVl5 — K.Diallo ☭ (@nyeusi_waasi) December 31, 2023\n\nDemands ahead of COP30\n\nFor African leaders, climate finance must shift from symbolic promises to meaningful reparations. They argue that financing should come as debt-free grants rather than loans that deepen dependency. Historic polluters owe this to frontline communities losing their farms to drought or their homes to rising seas. The Loss and Damage Fund, in particular, needs to prioritize these vulnerable communities with direct, rapid assistance: cash for families in sinking villages, support for starved farmlands, and investment in healthcare for climate-induced trauma. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said:\n\nToo often, Africa's story begins with what we lack: finance, technology, time. Let us instead begin with what we have: the youngest population in the world, vast solar resources, and the resilience to build a new climate economy.\n\nLeaders are also demanding stronger commitments from rich nations. During last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries from the global north pledged to pay USD300 billion in climate finance, but the amount falls far short of the USD1.3 trillion per year needed by African nations, who need it to effectively adapt and transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nACS2 came at a crucial moment when the Lake Chad Basin, which once supported millions across Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic, had shrunk by over 90 percent. With it, the livelihoods of countless families have evaporated. Africa is both the most vulnerable to climate collapse and one of the most promising centers for climate solutions. As the world heads towards COP30 in Brazil in November, Africans say they do not just want to be heard, but are demanding to be recognized as solution builders and shapers of the planet’s shared future.",

    "title": "The legacy of ‘sponge cities’ left by Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian",
    "text": "Yu Kongjian (俞孔坚), 62, the Chinese landscape architect who pioneered the concept of “sponge cities,” died in a plane crash in the Pantanal region, the largest tropical wetland in the world, in Brazil, on September 23, 2025. Three other people also died during the accident: pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, and filmmakers Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., who were both working with Yu to create a documentary about sponge cities. The cause of the crash is under investigation.\n\nFerraz’s work focused on nonfiction productions, including a series about the 2016 plane crash involving the Brazilian football team, Chapecoense. Crispim Jr. worked on projects such as a documentary about Brazilian architect Vilanova Artigas and another about the first women’s football national team in Brazil.\n\nBrazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, posted condolences on his X account and highlighted Yu's work:\n\nFoi com tristeza e consternação que recebi a notícia do desastre aéreo ocorrido no Pantanal no início da noite desta terça-feira, 23. A tragédia, infelizmente, custou as vidas do piloto Marcelo Pereira de Barros, dos documentaristas Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz e Rubens… — Lula (@LulaOficial) September 24, 2025\n\nIt was with sadness and consternation that I received the news about the aircraft disaster that happened in the Pantanal regional, early Tuesday night, the 23rd. The tragedy, unfortunately, took the lives of the pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, documentarians Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., and the Chinese architect Kongjian Yu. In times of climate change, Kongjian Yu became a world reference for sponge cities, which unite life quality and environment protection: something we want — and need — for the future. To all the victims’ friends, family and coworkers, I leave my deepest sorrows.\n\nYu’s legacy\n\nYu was in Brazil to work on a documentary, but he had also recently attended the São Paulo International Architecture Biennale, which was themed “EXTREMES — Architectures for an overheated planet.” Raquel Schenkman, the Institute of Brazilian Architects’ president, responsible for the Biennale’s organization, told G1 Yu was “someone on the frontline of transformations in big urban centers facing climate change.”\n\nOn its website, the Biennale published a note saying that, as the “creator of the theory of sponge cities, Yu Kongjian left a monumental legacy, also urgent to face climate crisis in cities,” and that his work, based on ecosystemic principles, “showed in a practical and poetic way how the landscape can be a vital infrastructure to urban resilience, integrating man to nature in a sustainable way.”\n\nSponge cities concept\n\nYu’s main legacy is designing and implementing projects based on his sponge cities theory. A professor at Peking University, his “sponge city” concept became a top national priority in China in 2013, following the massive floods in the Beijing region in 2012, which left 79 people dead and tens of thousands displaced. He also founded Turenscape, one of the main landscape architecture firms in the world, based in China.\n\nYu cautioned against overly “grey” cities that rely too much on concrete and asphalt, which disrupt natural water pathways and prevent the ground from absorbing water. While conventional water management focuses on draining water through engineered drainage infrastructure, such as pipes and water channels, sponge cities rely on techniques such as green roofs, rainwater storage and infiltration systems, sunken green spaces, permeable pavement, bioretention ponds, wetland revitalization, restoring natural waterflow pathways, and more.\n\n“Floods are not enemies,” Yu explained in an interview with WeForum. “We can make friends with floods. We can make friends with water.”\n\nYu’s approach to urban planning has been successfully implemented in dozens of cities in China, particularly after Chinese President Xi Jinping established his thoughts on ecological civilization in 2018.\n\nIn the past decade, his natural landscape approach is becoming an important tool in city planning and water management around the world.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, where recurring extreme weather events routinely cause massive floods that displace hundreds of thousands, many city planners are looking to sponge cities as a potential solution for unprecedented levels of rainfall.\n\nSo far, the concept has mostly been implemented on a small scale in individual neighborhoods, streets, or areas, meaning its flood mitigation impacts are often limited to the local level, rather than city- or nationwide.\n\nOn X, Zhongshan city's tourism promotion outlet, commemorates Yu's death by highlighting one of his landscape projects in the southern Chinese city:\n\nOn September 23 (Brazilian time), Professor Yu Kongjian from the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at #Peking University, tragically passed away in a plane crash at the age of 62. Professor Yu had won numerous world-class #design awards, including the Oberlander Prize and the John Cobb Common Good Award. Among his representative works is the #QijiangPark in #Zhongshan, #Guangdong . This #park, transformed from the site of a former shipyard, opened in 2001 and quickly gained global attention, winning several domestic and international design awards. In designing and building the park, Professor Yu and his team preserved the original industrial relics, such as shipyard machinery, docks, and other structures, and repurposed them with new functions. [original English version from @Amzhongshan]\n\nYu himself acknowledged that scaling up the pilot projects in Chinese cities was challenging. One of his sponge city projects in Zhengzhou faced backlash after a severe flood in 2021, which claimed 12 lives in the city, prompting many to express doubts about the practicality of his idea. Moreover, as China's coastal regions are highly industrialized, they demand cross-departmental collaboration, strong political will, and extensive administrative coordination to restore concrete riverbanks and seawalls to wetlands.\n\nIn an interview with Brazilian news outlet G1, Yu said that on a scale of 1 to 10, his optimism regarding the world’s chances of reversing climate change ranked 4. He also mentioned water scarcity — one of the challenges his projects aimed to address — as the primary issue humanity will face over the next 25 years.\n\nA journalist living in China, Isabela Shi, shared Yu Kongjian’s last update on a Chinese social media platform:\n\n🕯️No último vídeo que o arquiteto chinês Yu Kongjian divulgou na rede social chinesa, ele estava mostrando a viagem a Pantanal com equipa brasileira que tenta refletir sobre Planeta Esponja através de encolhimento de zonas húmidas. “Wonderful, amazing”, encantou ele pro Brasil. pic.twitter.com/fKn5ZKgIwe — Isabela Shi🇨🇳🇧🇷 (@ShiIsabela) September 25, 2025",

    "title": "How a comics school taught perseverance and creative freedom in Bosnia & Herzegovina",
    "text": "This article by Adin Kadrić first appeared in Balkan Diskurs on September 12, 2025. An edited version is being republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement with the Post-Conflict Research Center (PCRC).\n\nEditor's note: Zenica is a city in the middle of Bosnia and Herzegovina with about 100,000 residents. It is noted for its ironworks industry as well as being home to one of the big prisons in ex-Yugoslavia, described in the cult rock song Zenica Blues. It is not often considered when speaking about art, making the significance of this initiative — which began during the war of 1992-1995 and still persists to this day — even more extraordinary.\n\nFor over 30 years, the Zenica School of Comics has been not only an illustration school but a symbol of perseverance, cultural resistance, and lasting dedication to art. Initially conceived as an escape from the repression of the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and later, a platform for expression and creativity, the school has trained around 200 young artists. About 70 of them have gone on to become prominent young authors, whose works have left a mark on the domestic and regional comics scene.\n\nSeveral graduates are even acclaimed beyond the borders of their country, with Kenan Halilović, Biljana Šafaražik, and Zdravko Cvjetković being some of the most prominent. While the school has been synonymous with quality and creativity within the domestic comic scene for years, the international acclaim for these artists’ work underscores the fact that Zenica maintains a firm foothold in this visual medium.\n\nRecalling its beginnings, Adnadin Jašarević, the school’s founder and director of the Zenica City Museum, said that its primary goal was to give children a creative escape from the harsh realities of war. Under such conditions, comics were like Alice in Wonderland — providing an escape from hunger, fear, and shelling. An average of ten students still pass through the school every year, learning how to translate their thoughts, fears, and hopes into dynamic sequences of frames and speech clouds.\n\nNewer names like Filip Andronik, Milorad Vicanović, Senad Mavrić, and Enis Čišić represent the contemporary wave of comic artists from BiH. They actively cooperate with renowned publishers from the United States and Europe, demonstrating that despite its underdeveloped infrastructure, Bosnia and Herzegovina has comic creators who can stand equally alongside the best talent the genre has to offer.\n\nPublications such as “Horostop,” “ZE strip,” “EKO strip” and “SUV – Steps in Time” were created at the Zenica School, showcasing both its longevity and its dedication to comic culture. Explaining that the students themselves choose the topics they work on according to their own interests, Jašarević noted that he has “never stopped working” to ensure that comics remain a tool for expression and creative release.\n\nAs far as technology’s impact on the comic industry goes, Jašarević explained that while comics used to be widely available to the masses, they are now becoming a far more exclusive product, with expensive integral editions and albums intended for a small but loyal audience. While the idea behind ​​comics as a liberating medium remains the same, the development of technology has heralded a turn in modern-day comic production.\n\nCartoonist and former Zenica student Zdravko Cvjetković, in speaking about the impact of technology, emphasized that smart tablets have made drawing easier and faster for many artists, without compromising the quality of their work. However, he warned that AI tools — such as those used for generating text and images — pose serious ethical and aesthetic questions.\n\nHe believes that the mass availability of tools that produce images and stories in seconds, threatens to trivialize art and blur the line between creativity and automation: “If we all become artists just because we have a tool in our pocket, then nobody is really an artist.”\n\nMany things about comics today, according to Cvjetković, are drastically different than before the war: “Comics are no longer accessible to such a wide audience, especially children. They’re too expensive and rarely found in newsstands.”\n\nThe burgeoning Bosnian comics scene\n\nPointing out that children today reach for screens before print media like comics or books, Cvjetković said that publishers are therefore targeting older generations who grew up with comics.\n\nA positive outcome of this is the growing number of comics festivals in the region, which promote a culture of reading and drawing. “Workshops and comics contests for children [are] an almost mandatory part of every serious festival,” Cvjetković emphasized, “and this is crucial in the absence of comics schools like the one in Zenica.”\n\nComics culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina persists despite its modest ecosystem, in which there is almost no institutional support, and few major publishers or specialized festivals. However, thanks to the enthusiasm of individuals, the scene is not disappearing; in fact, it is quietly but steadily growing.\n\nAuthors like Berin Tuzlić and Enis Čišić have been representing BiH on the regional and international comics scene for years. Tuzlić, known for his experimental approach and multimedia projects, combines comics with music and animation. Čišić, who also tried his hand at Marvel productions, represents a more contemporary, technically precise form of expression. Their work shows that the country is producing talent capable of competing globally.\n\nIsmet Erdić also holds a special place on the BiH comics scene, with his rare combination of historical storytelling and visual narration in comics about Kulin Ban and medieval Bosnia. His work has educational value and is often used in classrooms, which makes him one of the few authors whose comics reach the general public.\n\nDespite unfavorable conditions for comic distribution, publicity, and marketing, comics culture in BiH is still preserved as a niche interest by enthusiasts. Social networks, web comics, and regional cooperation with authors from Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia are currently key to their survival. So, while relatively small, the BiH comics scene has an authentic flair and great potential, waiting for better times ahead.",

    "title": "Civil society initiative fights for equal education opportunities in Togo",
    "text": "In Togo, a national initiative built on civic solidarity helps relieve parents’ yearly back-to-school expenses.\n\nEducation is free and compulsory throughout the country, with a population of over 9.5 million. Following a two-month break (from mid-July to mid-September), more than 3 million students returned to school this month. While the authorities continue to work on improving education through teacher training and recruitment, investing in renovations and school infrastructure, the parents’ main priority is seeing their children succeed at the end of each school year.\n\nOver the years, there has been a marked increase in the gross enrollment rate and the proportion of Togolese students completing the school year. In April 2025, the local news website Lechiquier published:\n\n…le taut brut de scolarisation au primaire dépasse 100%. Il était de l’ordre de 111,70% en 2023, 116,70% en 2024 et une prévision de 116,20% pour l’année 2025. Dans le même sillage, le taux d’achèvement du primaire a évolué de 88,80% en 2023 à 94,60% en 2024. Pour l’année 2025, le gouvernement table sur une augmentation de 121,70%.\n\nThe gross primary school enrolment rate now exceeds 100 percent. In 2023, it was approximately 111.70 percent, in 2024 it was 116.70 percent, and 116.20 percent is forecast for 2025. Similarly, the primary school completion rate increased from 88.80 percent in 2023 to 94.60 percent in 2024. For 2025, the government forecasts an increase to 121.70 percent.\n\nThis rate of over 100 percent is due to it far exceeding the initial estimated value.\n\nFree school education\n\nTogo is one of five African countries with high enrollment rates in school, an impressive development stemming from the various reforms the authorities have implemented in the education sector. In 2008, Togo introduced free pre-school and primary education in the public sector. Since the beginning of the 2021–2022 school year, education in public secondary schools has also been free, a measure the authorities will maintain for the 2025–2026 school year.\n\nThese measures help combat inequities in accessing education. However, efforts, such as providing student school kits (notebooks, books, pens, pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, and school bags), are still required to tackle inequality and ensure universal coverage.\n\nTogo’s guaranteed monthly minimum wage (SMIG) increased from FCFA 35,000 (USD 64) in 2012 to FCFA 52,500 (USD 95) in early 2023. Although this measure was introduced to support the Togolese working population of over 4 million, not all are content with its implementation, condemning the country’s ongoing poor economic situation and challenging living conditions.\n\nAssociation contributions\n\nGiven the financial crisis, parents’ biggest concern is purchasing back-to-school supplies and kits. However, Togolese civil society provides solutions. Citizens, both young and old, are quick to lend their support to help parents meet these expenses.\n\nNumerous citizens, working as part of various associations, travel to the country’s villages and remote areas, assisting and supporting children, especially the most vulnerable. These efforts are a social and solidarity-based alternative to the associations committed to child protection, education, and development.\n\nOne example is Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (the Togolese Child Protection Association or LTPE). On August 29, 2025, LTPE supported 5,000 children from 12 villages of the Amou Prefecture in the Plateaux region.\n\nLe 29 août 2025, plus de 5 000 enfants de la préfecture d’Amou venus de 12 localités différentes ont reçu des kits scolaires grâce à l’initiative « Éducation pour tous : 1 élève, 1 kit, 1 choix de vie » portée par la #LTPE. pic.twitter.com/LMroVuE9oY — Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (@LTPE_ONG) August 30, 2025\n\nOn August 29, 2025, more than 5,000 children from 12 different locations in the Amou Prefecture received school kits through the #LTPE initiative ‘Education for All: One student, one kit, one life choice.’\n\nIn an interview with Togolese media outlet Plume d'Afrique, Nina Afi Kazoulé, the LTPE coordinator, explained the scope of this measure:\n\nNous voulons par cette action éviter le décrochage scolaire. Et nous savons que le décrochage scolaire peut être dû à l'incapacité financière des parents, aux grossesses en milieu scolaire, bref à tous les comportements qui ne sont pas appropriés à adopter par un apprenant.\n\nWe want to prevent school dropouts with this measure. We know that school dropouts can happen due to the parents’ lack of financial resources, pregnancies among school girls, or any inappropriate student behavior\n\nIn the village of Zooti N'titikope, Vogan, a town 45 kilometers northwest of the Togolese capital Lomé, the Togovi Bé Sourire association and Action for Peace and Good Governance (APGG) joined forces with several other associations on September 5 and 6 to support young learners. More than 300 vulnerable children received school kits, and 20 young girls will be monitored and supported in successfully reintegrating into school.\n\nLomé also has vulnerable children supported by other groups, including the Premiers Pas pour l’Enfance (First Steps for Children or 3PE) association. Its mission is to promote equal education opportunities through solidarity initiatives, such as the payment of school fees and supply provision for children. Association President Akilou Demon told media outlet Ledefenseur:\n\nNous voulons que tous les enfants aient accès à l’éducation, car l’enfant a droit à l’école. Si certains en sont privés, ce n’est pas juste. Notre ambition est de leur donner une chance égale de réussir et de contribuer demain au développement de notre patrie.\n\nAs children have the right to attend school, we want all children to have access to education. Some are deprived, and this is not fair. We aim to give them equal opportunities to succeed and one day contribute to our country’s development.\n\nAlthough the results of various reforms are visible, shortcomings remain in Togo’s education system.\n\nSchool infrastructure, such as classrooms, is substandard, especially in villages. Students study in straw huts with few school benches (supplemented in some places with bricks) and are forced to move or interrupt their lessons due to adverse weather conditions. In 2021, these circumstances led to construction plans for 30,000 classrooms equipped with wooden class benches. However, in September 2024, the government reduced its improvement projects by more than half, going from 30,000 classrooms to just 14,632.\n\nWhile civil society can offset some of the education system’s shortcomings, it’s ultimately up to the state, which declared education free and compulsory, to improve education quality and train new teachers to achieve equal opportunities for all Togolese children.",

    "title": "In Brazil, Romani people living in peripheral areas fight for recognition of their identities",
    "text": "This article, written by Artur Ferreira and Amanda Oliveira, was originally published on May 30, 2025, on the Agência Mural website. An edited version is published on Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nIn the collective imagination, the Romani people are associated with colourful clothing, parties, accessories, and an aura of mystery, embodying a wandering spirit. But beyond the stereotypes, there is a rich history of resistance and belonging that spans centuries, including in Brazil, in the outskirts of São Paulo.\n\nIn universities, public offices, doctors’ offices, or their traditional campsites, they are fighting for their rights, against prejudice, and for recognition in a country where there are still shortcomings in caring for the diversity of these communities.\n\nIn Itaim Paulista, a neighbourhood at the eastern end of the city, 250 people live in one of the main and oldest Romani campsites in the region.\n\n“Some Romanies palm read, dance, get dressed up in traditional clothing, but some are even evangelical, like myself, and they don’t all even live in camps. We are a people like any other,” the 32-year-old housewife Magda Santos says. She has been living in the camps for eight years with her husband and two children. “I am not Romani by blood, but I became one when I got married to one.”\n\nThe Romani, also known as the Roma peoples, are an ethnic group that doesn’t have a single origin. One of the more widely accepted theories is that they are of Indian origin but have travelled the world since the 11th century in a great diaspora, dispersing throughout the Balkans, Western Europe, and later to other continents.\n\nWhile she was hanging clothes on the clothesline, 29-year-old seamstress Viviane Alves Pereira made sure to find an answer when asked about the main problems her people face. The statement came without hesitation: prejudice, invisibility and the lack of access to basic rights, a common scenario in marginalized neighbourhoods.\n\nWho are the Roma people from the outskirts?\n\nThe majority of Romani who live on the outskirts of Greater São Paulo are of the Calon ethnicity, like Magda and Viviane. They are also those who suffer the most prejudice relating to maintaining their traditions and being most recognized as “gypsies” (a term now considered derogatory), because of their clothing and their nomadic lifestyle, according to sources from this report.\n\nIn Brazil, there are two other Romani ethnic groups: the Roma and the Sinti peoples. They don’t wear traditional clothing, so they mostly go unnoticed in the cities.\n\n“Many Brazilians were already cared for by doctors, nurses and Romani lawyers, and maybe they don’t even know,” states activist Nicolas Ramanush, 64, who is the president of the NGO, Romani Embassy of Brazil (Embaixada Cigana do Brasil), in Santo André in the Greater São Paulo area.\n\n“In the region, Romani people were concentrated in the neighborhood of Itaim Paulista and in the cities of Itaquaquecetuba and Itapevi, with camps near the train stations,” he says.\n\nEach ethnicity is divided into subgroups, and each one develops its own customs, habits, religions and rituals. “In my ethnic group, for example, we always wear decorated shoes with a lot of details. Some Calon women are famous for their flowery dresses and for using handkerchiefs,” says Ramanush, who belongs to the Sinti ethnicity.\n\nThis group has the fewest number of people in the country. “Today, if there are 100 families in Brazil, it is a lot,” says Ramanush. “This is because of the period of Nazism. The Sintis were almost exterminated. Among the Romani killed during the Holocaust, the majority were Sinti and Roma,” he adds.\n\nRamanush notes that many aspects of Romani culture are integrated into the Brazilian lifestyle without most people realizing it. They were among those responsible for helping Carnival to grow, especially in the northeast, creating Carnival street blocks. Certain costumes, such as “La Ursa” (The Bear) in Recife, have a Romani origin.\n\n“Instruments like the seven or six-string guitar were brought to Brazil by the Roma people. Some samba dancers spoke about how living with the Romanies inspired them musically,” Ramanush says.\n\nUnder the canvas tents\n\nNomadic and outskirt-dwelling Romani have a routine defined by difficulties surrounding education for their children and lack of healthcare, caused by the lack of a stable address. They also face São Paulo’s structural problems, such as floods, and living under canvas tents, without safety.\n\nOne of the most impactful natural disasters was the flooding in February 2025 in the far east of São Paulo, in the region known as Jardim Pantanal. The streets and houses remained underwater for several days. The Romani in these camps had to face that situation under the tents.\n\n“We spent days underwater, and it was the neighbors from the region who helped us,” Santos remembers with outrage.\n\nThe camp’s inhabitants had to deal with a lack of drinking water; tents were affected, and according to local accounts, they had to make a joint effort to avoid major losses of furniture and appliances while the flooding advanced.\n\nJust like Santos, Ramanush believes that the first step to improving the Romani community’s life in the outskirts of Brazil is for them not to be invisible.\n\nPrejudice and invisibility\n\nEven with initiatives such as the National Day of Roma Peoples, commemorated every May 24 since 2006, some rights are still neglected. For example, Romani people are not recognized in the national census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).\n\nSantos remembers the difficulty she faced in registering her children’s ethnic group in their identity documents. Since there is no official recognition of “Romani” ethnicity, she ended up registering them by their skin color.\n\n“There are policies catered to Indigenous peoples, Black and Brown people, but not for Romani people. We have our own culture, but we do not show up, which is why I say being Romani is being invisible,” she claims.\n\nRamanush experienced a similar situation when a census taker visited him during the most recent census in Brazil in 2022. “She asked me what my race was, and I answered that it was not on the list. My complexion is white, but I’m a Romani.”\n\nIBGE estimates that Brazil has between 800,000 and a million Romani, but the Roma groups believe the numbers are higher.\n\n“I've already travelled all over Brazil meeting Romani people from all ethnic groups. Without official data, there are no efficient public policies,” Ramanush explains. “Even to count how many Romani there are in each city or town, local governments make the process difficult.”\n\nBesides the lack of recognition, Romani people living in peripheral areas also face a prejudice that runs through generations. They have been accused of theft, robbery, and deception for centuries. It wasn’t rare to have them associated with kidnapping children.\n\nTrying to change this reality and fight prejudice, Romani groups have been mobilized for the approval of a bill making teaching Romani culture and history in schools mandatory — modeling what already happens with Black and Indigenous people in Brazil. The proposal presented by federal deputy Helder Salomão (PT, Workers’ Party), at the Chamber of Deputies as Bill 3547 of 2015, has made little progress.\n\nIn their justification, the text reinforces the idea that for centuries Romani groups have been experiencing prejudice, marginalization, exclusion and persecution. So, the bill aims to “change the image of Romani populations, trying to reduce prejudice and discrimination that these groups are subjected to.”\n\nThe bill also asserts that providing visibility for Romani groups “will provide a more fertile ground to build public policies focusing on the promotion of human rights.”",

    "text": "This article was published by Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand. An edited version has been republished by Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement.\n\nBetween July and May 2025, tensions between Thailand and Cambodia over a border dispute devolved into violence that left at least 43 dead on both sides, dozens injured, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Despite signing a ceasefire agreement on July 28, hostility has remained deeply embedded in both countries, fueled by misinformation. Amidst the turmoil, Cambodians and Thais have come together to launch a cross-border campaign aimed at combating hatred and promoting empathy and lasting peace.\n\nThailand and Cambodia share over 700 kilometres of border, where several undemarcated sections have been long-standing sources of conflict between the two countries, since the Preah Vihear dispute beginning in the 1950s, to this year when clashes broke out on May 28th and led to fatalities on July 24th. On top of that, the countries also share historical and cultural ties, which have complicated the tensions between them, leading to deep-rooted hostility between the two peoples.\n\nHostility skyrocketed after the July 24 armed conflict as the conflict between the two governments trickled down to all facets of society. Cambodian and Thai netizens traded accusations on who initiated the clashes.\n\n“We see all the problems start to unfold, and when hatreds, prejudice, and discrimination on people’s level have gone online, it was even more devastating for us, and that's why we decided to come together on the Cambodian side to rally among ourselves,” said Lim Solinn, a Cambodian social activist and artist. She later reached out to friends in Thailand in different places and then stumbled upon a group of Thai people who are a network of solidarity.\n\nOu Tepphallin, a Cambodian labor rights activist and campaign co-organizer, said she joined the campaign to address the suffering of migrant workers and communities caught in the crossfire of recent tensions, particularly Cambodian workers in Thailand and Thai workers in Cambodia.\n\nThey faced physical violence and racism, and they were living with fear, so their voices were unheard. On top of that, children living along the border have lost opportunities to study due to the closure of border crossings. Family members were separated, such as a child whose mother was in Thailand but whose father was in Phnom Penh, and they have no idea when they can be reunited.\n\nIn addition, according to the Thai authorities, the conflict since July 24th has also caused over 500,000 Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand to return home, since most of them felt unsafe and threatened in Thailand. This has left Thailand with a significant labor shortage as Cambodian migrants typically played an essential role in the country's agricultural industry.\n\nSolinn stated that both Thai and Cambodian campaign organizers want the campaign to go viral in both countries and send messages to leaders saying, “Please don't use violence on Cambodian or Thai migrant workers.”\n\nThe campaigners are also trying to figure out catchy ways for this campaign to go viral and reach regular Thais and Cambodians. The campaign includes writing poems and making songs, which they believe could help calm people and encourage them not to hate simply because of what they heard or saw on the news.\n\n“We’re just starting, even if the war ends tomorrow, the hatred continues, so we need to continue this work and reach out to more communities in Cambodia and in Thailand,” said Solinn.\n\nPhallin added that it's time to heal those who suffered from both sides, and that is what the campaign did by starting to send healing messages to ordinary people.\n\nWhen hatred is louder than empathy\n\nIn Thailand, when the armed conflict erupted and innocent Thai civilians and military personnel were killed, many Thai netizens demanded tit for tat retaliation. In addition, right-wing influencers have threatened Cambodian migrant workers and called on patriots to use violence against them.\n\nOften, those who oppose this and call for a peaceful approach face condemnation online for being too optimistic or unpatriotic.\n\n“All the ordinary Cambodians want nothing but peace and harmony with our neighbours, and a lot of people get caught in between these polarizations, and because of the level of their vulnerability, they cannot get their voices heard at all,” noted Solinn.\n\nOn the Cambodian side, Solinn remarked that while they wanted peace and for this war to stop, most Cambodians also became enraged and emotional when they saw news about civilians being affected, schools being bombed, or news that many people were displaced.\n\nShe disclosed that since she and her friends launched the campaign, she has been harassed by netizens from both countries. For her, it has been difficult to get through to people how the hyper-nationalistic, violent narratives are spreading hate. Solinn said:\n\nThey have been misinformed and disinformed. They believe these sets of stories, and they have these perspectives, and it's hard to change. So, instead of trying to tell them a different version, we’re trying to appeal to their consciousness. We try to appeal to their empathy.\n\nEven though most of the information they received was not real, it was effective as it was coupled with prejudice, stereotyping, and hate speech amplified by social media. “It has added fuel to the fire of ultra nationalist perspectives. It just made it really hard for people to try to bridge across for people who are like us,” said Solinn.\n\nShe insisted that engaging with the same outrage and accusing each other of doing what each side thinks is wrong will not improve the situation, particularly for disputes that have been going on for hundreds of years, based on selective history from both sides.\n\nSolinn emphasized that it was time to put people’s lives first. Children should be able to return to school instead of living in refugee camps, families should be able to earn their livelihoods again, and both countries need to recognize the damage the conflict has inflicted on their economies.\n\nA call for peace: rebuilding trust and fostering empathy\n\n“We would like to urge the leaders to sit down and find a peaceful resolution and put the people first,” said Phallin. She also urged the leaders to negotiate and rebuild trust, insisting that peace can be achieved only by negotiation, not war.\n\nIn the meantime, Solinn urged the leaders to be compassionate and gentle and to reach a peaceful resolution, adding that a tremendous amount of strength is required. The campaign organizer also called on leaders on both sides to stop this war and allow everything to return to normal for the sake of the innocent people from both countries.\n\nShe suggested that Thailand and Cambodia stop promoting biases and stereotypes based on selective interpretations of history, particularly for the younger generations.\n\nSolinn also believes that when this war ends, Thais and Cambodians will come together to create mixed communities where people from both sides could share safe spaces and raise awareness of peace and harmony.\n\n“Educating in school or through the media wouldn't be enough. We need all the spaces, all the communities, we need a whole society to heal and to promote racial tolerance, peace, solidarity, and harmony,” said Phallin.\n\nIn terms of media, Solinn said media, particularly mainstream media, in both countries should not amplify hateful rhetoric, which has already been dominant on social media, but rather people’s stories, which would help promote reconciliation and peace, suggesting that selective parts of the history on both sides shouldn’t be allowed to frame the whole narrative about Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nShe noted that we did not know everything, but only heard different sides of the story. Each side believed the other started the war first or believed that the other side encroached upon their land.\n\n“Trust is so fragile. It's so easy to break, and it's broken already. It's very hard to rebuild, but we must try. We do not have a choice,” noted Solinn.",

    "title": "The judiciary’s dilemma: Protecting Nigeria’s whistleblowers without legislation",
    "text": "Nigeria’s whistleblower policy, introduced on December 21, 2016, was designed as a quick fix to expose systemic corruption. It promised whistleblowers between 2.5 and 5 percent of recovered looted public funds. However, while the policy incentivizes disclosures, it does not guarantee protection.\n\nInstead, whistleblowers often face surveillance, dismissal, or even death threats. Multiple attempts to pass a whistleblower protection bill over the years have stalled in Nigeria’s National Assembly, leaving whistleblowers legally vulnerable.\n\nNigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework\n\nOn September 18, 2025, Federal High Court judges and civil society advocates debated on Nigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework at a national interactive forum convened by the African Centre for Media & Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) for federal high court judges, in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city.\n\nHarry Ogwuche, the Director of Economic and Social Rights at Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), shared during the debate:\n\nProtecting whistleblowers is not an abstract anti-corruption strategy; it is a direct, proactive investment in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights as enshrined in Chapter IV of our Constitution and various international covenants Nigeria is party to.\n\nThe role of judges in protecting whistleblowers\n\nWhile seeking the support of judges in the advocacy for a whistleblower protection law in Nigeria, Chido Onumah, Coordinator of AFRICMIL, said:\n\nJudges are key actors in any judicial system. Therefore, the forum aims to provide a platform for interaction with judges on whistleblowing, its legal framework, and the critical role they play in ensuring justice for whistleblowers and handling corruption cases effectively.\n\nAt the forum, persecuted whistleblower Yisa Usman shared how he was pressured, intimidated, and sidelined from his profession after blowing the whistle on his company. Usman is a chartered accountant who worked in the finance and accounts department, but after exposing corruption, he was redeployed to the ICT department, transferred to different states, and subsequently fired. He said:\n\nBecause I decided to speak up, I am jobless. I was ostracized and frustrated to accept the norm. To remain silent is to be complicit. To achieve results as a whistleblower, it is important to be familiar with the laws because if you know the laws that guide and protect you, you will be able to challenge them. Despite several attempts to detain me, I am walking free because of the judiciary.\n\nExisting and pending laws to protect whistleblowers\n\nNigeria’s Constitution and several statutes already contain protections that could be extended to whistleblowers. These include: Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. Section 6(4)(c) of the National Human Rights Commission Act prohibits harassment of individuals who cooperate with the Commission. Anti-corruption laws like the EFCC Act and ICPC Act provide limited safeguards. The Freedom of Information Act protects disclosures made in good faith.\n\nIn practice, these fragmented provisions are inconsistently applied, and without a unified protection law, whistleblowers continue to face retaliation.\n\nNigeria’s situation contrasts sharply with that of its regional neighbors. Ghana’s Whistleblower Act (Act 720) and South Africa’s Protected Disclosures Act provide dedicated mechanisms.\n\nVladimir Radomirović, a Serbian journalist and co-founder of Pištaljka, an organization based in Belgrade that provides free legal aid and protection to whistleblowers, shared his experiences of building alliances with the judiciary to strengthen whistleblower protection in Serbia. He said:\n\nThe judges have a very influential role in protecting whistleblowers in Serbia, and we try to work with judges and allow them to hear from whistleblowers about how they are retaliated against for protecting the public interest.\n\nAFRICMIL and its partners urged the Nigerian legislature to urgently enact the whistleblower protection law, one that guarantees anonymity, provides penalties against retaliation, and establishes an independent body to oversee cases.\n\nWhistleblowers and civil society organizations appealed to judges to embrace a proactive role in safeguarding whistleblowers. They called for progressive adjudication that interprets existing laws in the spirit of transparency and protection for defenders; expedited hearings to ensure justice is not delayed and therefore denied; the awarding of exemplary damages against retaliators to serve as a deterrent; and above all, the protection of anonymity in court procedures. These recommendations, they argued, are vital if the judiciary is to strengthen trust, uphold justice, and ensure that whistleblowing truly serves as a tool for accountability in Nigeria.",

    "title": "Nepal’s Khoj Samachar challenges corruption and empowers youth through digital media",
    "text": "There are nearly 4,900 registered print media outlets in Nepal. Around eighteen news outlets operate exclusively online through digital platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. By law, online media must register with Nepal’s Department of Information and Broadcasting; however, not all outlets currently comply with this requirement.\n\nStanding out among these registered outlets is Khoj Samachar, an independent digital media platform that raises awareness among young people, challenges corruption, and amplifies underrepresented voices in Nepal. Its founder, Roshan Shrestha, is an investigative journalist from Nepal. His approach relies on digital platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and a dedicated app to draw public attention to marginalized stories and pressure authorities to take action. The platform publishes content in Nepali, in both text and video formats.\n\nAbdulrosheed Fadipe of Global Voices interviewed Roshan via WhatsApp to discuss his journey as an investigative journalist and how he uses digital platforms to promote social change, strengthen good governance, and encourage citizen engagement in Nepal.\n\nGlobal Voices (GV): What inspired you to start Khoj Samachar, and what challenges did you face in building it from scratch?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): I started my journalism journey during my school years at Shree Bachchhala Devi Higher Secondary School, Nagpuje, Sindhupalchok District, in Bagmati Province of Nepal. When I was in class 8, a man who was the presenter at Avenues Television came to my school to teach students about journalism. That training programme planted the seed of journalism in my mind.\n\nMy interest in journalism grew after a devastating earthquake occurred in Nepal in 2015. Although the epicenter of the earthquake was located in Gorkha district, many houses in my village, which is located near the Bhotekoshi River, were destroyed. Many people lost their lives. The Tataponi border crossing with China was also closed. I had just completed class 11 then. I was using a simple Android phone because I was from a low-middle-class family that depended on agriculture for a living. With that phone, I started filming and uploading videos of the earthquake's destruction of villages on a YouTube channel. This was how my journalism career began.\n\nIn 2021, I officially launched Khoj Samachar. I did not receive any financial support when I started nor did I have a big team. Now we have a team of four individuals broadcasting news in both English and Nepali.\n\nGV: How do you maintain editorial independence and ensure your outlet's content remains unbiased and free from external influences?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): We do not take money, favors, or support from any political party, business group, or outside donor. From day one, Khoj Samachar has survived only through the income we earn from Facebook and YouTube ads. With those limited earnings, we pay our team and run the entire platform. This is not always easy, but it gives us full freedom. Nobody can tell us what to say or what to hide. We can question leaders, expose corruption, and speak for the people without fear of losing sponsors or upsetting funders. Our only loyalty is to our readers and viewers. For us, independence is more valuable than comfort. Even if the road is difficult, we choose truth over compromise — that is why our content remains unbiased and trusted.\n\nGV: How do you prioritize stories that amplify underrepresented media voices, and what impact do you hope these stories have on your audience?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): At Khoj Samachar, we always give priority to the voices that big media often ignores — farmers, workers, rural youth, and ordinary citizens who face injustice. Many times, people from villages directly contact us to share their pain, because they feel unheard elsewhere.\n\nWe have highlighted stories like that of a person struggling to get a bridge built in his village, a road left unfinished for 10 years, or a family trapped in hardship without support. By showing these issues through videos, we try to bring public attention and pressure the authorities to act.\n\nOur hope is that by giving a platform to these underrepresented voices, young people will feel more connected, more aware, and inspired to raise their own voices. We want our audience to see that journalism is not only about leaders and cities, but also about the real struggles of common people — and that truth can bring real change.\n\nGV: What strategies do you use to reach audiences beyond capital cities, and how do you measure the impact of your reporting in these areas?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): From the beginning, our focus was not only on Kathmandu but also on rural and remote areas. We create stories that reflect the real problems of villages — like missing bridges in Humla, neglected roads in Dailekh, or migrant workers’ struggles. Many of these issues are sent to us directly by local people through phone calls, Facebook messages, or our app. By turning their voices into reports and videos, we make sure their problems are heard nationally.\n\nTo measure impact, we look at the response from citizens and authorities. For example, in Saudi Arabia, when stranded workers contacted us, our coverage led to parliamentary debates and direct government action. Similarly, when we cover local problems, we monitor community feedback in comments, shares, and messages, and also check if the government or local representatives respond. For us, the real impact is when ordinary people feel their voices are finally heard and some positive change begins.\n\nGV: What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced as an independent journalist, and how have you overcome them?\n\nRS: There have been many difficult moments in my journey, but the most painful ones came when some people, who are unable to accept the truth, started abusing my family and even threatened physical attacks in public. As a journalist, I can tolerate criticism and risk, but when my family is dragged into controversy for my work, it is truly unbearable.\n\nSpeaking the truth, especially against corruption and powerful figures, always brings political pressure. Many tried to silence us or scare us into stopping, but journalism loses its meaning if we compromise with fear. What keeps me going is the trust and support of the public and the inner courage to always speak the truth. The emotional burden is heavy, but I continue because ordinary people rely on us to be their voice, and that responsibility gives me the strength to move forward.\n\nGV: How do you envision the future of Khoj Samachar, and what steps are you taking to ensure its sustainability and continued impact?\n\nRS: My main goal is to build Khoj Samachar as a platform based only on truth and facts, not dependent on external funding or political power. The message I want to pass to youth is that they can succeed in journalism by standing for the truth, even if they are alone. I am working to add more features to the Roshan Shrestha App so that it will be useful for the public. This step will help us sustain our work, expand our impact, and keep serving society with independent journalism.\n\nGV: Why did you name the Roshan Shrestha App after yourself?\n\nRS: By putting my own name on the app, I wanted to assure users that this platform is genuine, transparent, and trustworthy. It is not for self-promotion but rather a matter of responsibility: if my name is attached, people know they can rely on it.",

But sharp cuts to foreign aid by a number of governments are shrinking the available funds for nonprofits, with digital rights organizations like ours taking a particular hit.\n\nAnd it’s a hard time for news and translation organizations right now, with new technologies being used to cut staff and mass-produced disinformation crowding out quality news. Even in this challenging time, Global Voices’ production and readership have been going up, but since we are committed to never paywalling and not showing ads, that doesn’t translate into covering our running costs unless readers donate.\n\nGlobal Voices is a relatively low-cost organization to run: we have no office, no rent, and few physical supplies. We pay for the servers that host our site and a few other administrative costs, but by far the majority of our expenses are for paying our staff. Many grants don’t want to fund more than a small percentage of personnel costs, because they want to pay directly for activities, but personnel costs are the basis of all our activities. Our staff and our volunteers research stories, write and edit, translate and advocate — and sometimes they also do graphic design or photo choice, social media promotion, and more. That is who we’re trying to support with the funds from this campaign — our community, the people who make the articles and essays, translations, research reports, and podcasts that you find on our site.\n\nIf we had a dollar for every page view of the site, we wouldn't need to do a campaign! And if each of those dollars were a monthly commitment, we’d be able to plan ahead for longer-term activities and be generally less stressed. But we know that not everyone can contribute for lots of different reasons, so instead we can think about it as five dollars from one-fifth of the monthly site visits, or ten dollars from one-tenth, and maybe someone who hasn't read anything this month but believes in what we do kicks in twenty-five bucks, and someone else who loves translations sends another fifteen and… you get the idea.\n\nWe hope that you can be one of those contributors, and if you can’t right now, we hope you still come and spend time on our site, and then tell other people about it. Even more than a news site, Global Voices is a community, and we’d like you to be a part of it.

    "title": "The paradox of women’s rights in Peru",
    "text": "By Grecia Flores Hinostroza\n\nIn Peru, women’s rights exist in a strange paradox: on paper, we have the laws, the representation, and the international commitments that promise equality; in reality, our lives tell a different story. Political progress coexists alongside persistent neglect, with numbers that flatter and figures that fail. This contradiction is not hidden in the shadows — the painful contrast is written plainly in the numbers we so proudly display.\n\nAccording to the SDG Gender Index, Peru scores 72.9 for “Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments,” a figure that suggests progress, visibility, and leadership. And yet, when we shift our gaze to health, the score drastically drops to 35.5, barely half. Women are present in Congress, but absent from the healthcare system that should protect them.\n\nIf political participation alone were enough, our streets would be safer, our hospitals accessible, and our voices heard beyond the voting booth. But in Peru, as in much of Latin America, representation has not broken the chains of inequality — it has simply made them less visible to those who govern.\n\nThe data tells one story. The lives of rural, Indigenous, and poor women tell another — one where access to basic sexual and reproductive health services is a distant reality. Where hospitals, experts, and care are unreachable. As the political scientist Stéphanie Rousseau notes in “The Politics of Reproductive Health in Peru,” “Although health sector reforms have had some positive impact on women’s reproductive health, the many restrictions placed on women’s right to reproductive choices have blocked further progress.”\n\nThe consequences are not abstract. In 2020, Peru’s maternal mortality ratio stood at 69 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the World Health Organization, far above the Latin American average of 45 and nearly five times that of Chile (16) and Uruguay (13). These numbers represent women whose lives could have been saved by timely care, safe births and the fulfilment of rights already recognized by law.\n\nBut these injustices are not only moral failures; they are legal betrayals. Peru has signed its name beneath international promises: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and others. These are not distant treaties gathering dust in diplomatic archives. They are binding commitments, written to safeguard the dignity, health, and safety of women — commitments meant to reach every hospital room, courtroom, and remote village in our country.\n\nLaws protecting sexual and reproductive health rights exist on paper, but they remain distant from the realities of rural, Indigenous, and poor women. Clinics lack essential services. Comprehensive reproductive care is unavailable. Legal frameworks declare equality, but equality disappears in places where women still face forced pregnancies, unsafe births, and systemic neglect.\n\nThe Constitution speaks of equality, but equality does not walk the roads where women carry their pregnancies alone. The Ministry of Health issues protocols, but those protocols do not save lives when the nearest health centre is closed, or when the only doctor is gone. Rights without access are hollow. Commitments without implementation are betrayal.\n\nIn this context, political representation must not be mistaken for liberation. We cannot accept the illusion of progress that comes from more women in office if it is not matched by concrete action to dismantle structural barriers. Empowerment is not an empty slogan — it is the lived reality without fear, accessing healthcare without barriers, and raising one’s voice without retaliation.\n\nThe gap between law and life is not an abstract policy flaw; it is a daily crisis. It is the young girl in a rural province forced to give birth after sexual assault because abortion is inaccessible. It is the mother who dies on the way to a hospital that never has the capacity to treat her. Likewise, it is the Indigenous community where reproductive rights exist only in the language of faraway courts, not in the practice of local healthy systems.\n\nIf we measure success only by the presence of women in power, we ignore the absence of justice in their communities. Numbers in parliament cannot compensate for empty maternity wards. International recognition cannot replace the right to safe childbirth.\n\nI call on the Peruvian Congress to legislate not for appearances, but for autonomy. To ensure that health, safety, and dignity are realities in every province. I call on international donors to fund the fight for reproductive freedom, not just political participation. And I call on Peruvian society to recognize that representation without rights is no victory at all.\n\nRepresentation matters. But it is only the beginning. Real empowerment is when every woman controls her future — her body, her health, her voice — regardless of where she was born or how far she lives from the capital. Until the day, the paradox will remain, and progress will be a promise half-kept.",

    "summary": "By Grecia Flores HinostrozaIn Peru, women’s rights exist in a strange paradox: on paper, we have the laws, the representation, and the international commitments that promise equality; in reality, our lives tell a different story.\nAs the political scientist Stéphanie Rousseau notes in “The Politics of Reproductive Health in Peru,” “Although health sector reforms have had some positive impact on women’s reproductive health, the many restrictions placed on women’s right to reproductive choices have blocked further progress.”The consequences are not abstract.\nPeru has signed its name beneath international promises: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and others.\nLaws protecting sexual and reproductive health rights exist on paper, but they remain distant from the realities of rural, Indigenous, and poor women.\nLikewise, it is the Indigenous community where reproductive rights exist only in the language of faraway courts, not in the practice of local healthy systems.",

    "title": "Pro-government campaign against student protests attempts to justify repression in Serbia",
    "text": "This analysis by Nataša Stanojević was originally published by the International and Security Affairs Centre (ISAC), part of the regional initiative Western Balkans Anti-Disinformation Hub. An edited version is republished by Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nThe protest held on June 28 this year in Belgrade, on the Serbian national and religious holiday, Vidovdan, represented the culmination of months of public discontent with government policies and systemic societal problems.\n\nVidovdan is deeply rooted in national history and collective memory and has often been used as a symbol of political and moral struggle. In this case, students and other citizens chose the date to underscore the seriousness of their demands for responsible governance, to call for snap elections, and advocate for essential institutional reforms.\n\nAccording to estimates, the protest gathered around 140,000 people, making it one of the largest political gatherings in the past decade. The sheer size of the turnout reflects profound social frustration and a sense that institutional mechanisms for expressing discontent have completely failed. However, while the organizers’ demands were clearly defined — fighting corruption, institutional accountability, and democratization of the system — pro-government media constructed an entirely different picture.\n\nInstead of fact-based reporting, the public sphere was flooded with sensationalist headlines and claims aimed at delegitimizing the protests and criminalizing participants. The student movement and citizens were not portrayed as advocates of democratic values, but as a threat to the stability of the state. This strategy of criminalization, typical of authoritarian regimes, allowed the authorities to justify the use of force and intensified repression.\n\nPro-government media in Serbia systematically employ false and manipulative narratives to discredit legitimate civic protests and normalize the state’s repressive responses. Analysis shows that key propaganda tactics include labeling participants, manipulating events, constructing an image of a foreign enemy, and glorifying police force. These practices have long-term consequences for democratic processes and freedom of expression.\n\nInstruments of the propaganda narrative\n\nOne of the most commonly used strategies was the deployment of pejorative labels. Organizers and participants were not referred to as students or citizens but as “blockaders,” “hooligans,” and “terrorists.”\n\nA headline in the tabloid newspaper Informer, “Anti-hooligan operation in the city center: Watch how blockaders are arrested,” illustrates how police intervention was presented as necessary and legitimate, while citizens were criminalized. The term “terrorists” carries particularly strong connotations, suggesting extremism, even though the protests were peaceful in nature.\n\nMedia outlets widely circulated narratives about an alleged “hellish plan” by demonstrators. Headlines such as “Bridges and the entire city under siege: The new hellish plan of blockader terrorists, they want blood and dead bodies on the streets!” create an atmosphere of fear and suggest inevitable escalation into violence. These unfounded claims serve to mobilize the government’s loyal voter base and legitimize repressive measures. Rhetoric about “blood on the streets” and “danger to citizens” not only criminalizes protest participants but also frames them as a national security threat.\n\nPro-government discourse attributed goals to the protesters, such as “destroying the state” and “overthrowing the president.” These claims are not based on any documents or public statements by organizers, whose demands focused on improving safety, fighting corruption, and ensuring political accountability. Introducing accusations of “treason” and “collaboration with enemies” is part of a broader model of political propaganda in which social resistance is portrayed as a conspiracy against national interests.\n\nWhile pro-government media insisted on an image of violent demonstrations, actual events tell a different story. According to reports from independent media and human rights organizations, the majority of the protest was peaceful. This was also confirmed by the Council of Europe.\n\nThe few incidents that occurred happened only after police intervention, during which excessive force was used. The arrests or detentions of hundreds of people, along with documented cases of physical abuse, clearly show that state repression was the dominant dynamic. This gap between the media narrative and empirical facts is a classic example of the framing technique — selective presentation of reality to shape public opinion.\n\nThe broader political context and the foreign enemy narrative\n\nParticularly concerning is the strategy of linking the protests to alleged foreign enemies, in this case, Croatia. Certain tabloids and politicians suggested that the organizers of the protests were instruments in the hands of Croatian intelligence structures and that their goal was the destabilization of Serbia. These claims have no factual basis, but serve a clear propaganda purpose: to evoke historical tensions and use national stereotypes to create a sense of threat among citizens. (The hostilities between Serbia and Croatia have deep roots in their national narratives. These tensions began during the Ottoman Empire when many Serbian refugees were settled in Croatia by the Austrian authorities. The animosity intensified during World War II when Croatia joined the Axis powers, and was solidified during the wars that accompanied Yugoslavia’s breakup. This period culminated in Operation Storm, which resulted in the majority of Serbs fleeing Croatia.)\n\nThe use of Croatia in this narrative has a dual function: first, to mobilize patriotic sentiment; by suggesting that the protests are connected to a “hostile state,” the government reinforces its image as the defender of national interests. Second, it discredits the opposition and civic initiatives; by attributing “foreign influence” to the protests, the government delegitimizes their goals and diverts attention from internal problems such as corruption and institutional breakdown. This rhetoric relies on the well-known model of “constructing a foreign enemy,” which, according to political communication theory, serves to homogenize the electorate and justify authoritarian practices.\n\nA particularly alarming segment of the propaganda campaign concerns the linkage of protests with the issue of Srebrenica. (The 1995 massacre of the Muslim population in Srebrenica and its surrounding areas by the Army of Republika Srpska is frequently exploited by both nationalist and anti-Western factions in Serbia. Similar to narratives that deny the Holocaust, discussions about Srebrenica range from complete denial to unsettling debates about the number of victims, their nationality, and the use of terms like “necessary military action” and “collateral damage.” Over the past 15 years, anyone who does not support these narratives has been labeled a “traitor” or a “Western agent” in official political discourse.)\n\nIn an Informer article entitled “They’ve exposed themselves! This is blockader politics: Accusing Serbia of a nonexistent genocide in Srebrenica,” students were accused of “agreeing with accusations that brand Serbs as a genocidal nation.” This narrative attempts to shift the focus from demands for democratization to a national question, creating the impression that the protests have an “anti-Serbian agenda.” In this way, civic resistance is criminalized through manipulation of one of the most emotionally charged issues in the public sphere.\n\nA similar rhetoric is used by the portal Vaseljenska in the article “Blockaders want to declare Serbs a genocidal nation: Elections, then a government that will recognize the genocide in Srebrenica.” These claims are absent from any official demands of the organizers, but their function is clear: to discredit the protests by linking them with alleged plans to “betray national interests.” Thus, the government constructs a narrative in which students are not only “hooligans” but also agents of dangerous ideological and political projects.\n\nNarrative vs objective facts\n\nIn the long term, such practices lead to the consolidation of authoritarian patterns of governance. When every criticism of regime representatives is labeled as “treason” or “terrorism,” the space for democratic dialogue disappears. This not only delegitimizes protests but also undermines the fundamental values on which modern democratic societies rest.\n\nThis analysis of the media narrative surrounding the Vidovdan protests demonstrates that pro-government media act as a propaganda apparatus whose primary function is the preservation of political power, not informing the public. Through the dissemination of a distorted perception of civic resistance, the construction of violent scenarios, and the invention of foreign enemies, the authorities succeed in delegitimizing valid social demands and justifying repressive measures. Such a strategy may stabilize the regime in the short term, but in the long run, it erodes the foundations of democracy and leads to further political and social crises.",

    "text": "This Dart Centre Asia Pacific Report by Arun Karki was originally published in Nepali Times, and an edited version has been republished on Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.\n\nWhat should a journalist do when young protesters are shot in front of her? Does she do her job and stay neutral? Can you stay neutral?\n\nAs Gen Z protests engulfed Kathmandu, Nepal's journalists found themselves reporting a story that was personal. While doing their job, some of them were even targeted by mobs.\n\nRead More: Gen Z stands up to expose corruption in Nepal\n\nDart Asia Pacific Fellow Arun Karki visited their newsrooms and spoke with his colleagues about their experience of reporting the Gen Z protests that erupted on September 8th. These are the first-hand accounts of journalists who witnessed the turmoil in the city they call home.\n\nSunita Karki was at a workshop in a hotel on September 8th. She saw the first waves of protests through hotel windows. Curfew alerts flooded her phone, a vehicle belonging to a human rights group sat burning across the road, young boys were taking their wounded friends on motorbikes to local hospitals, and police were beating a teenager with their hands raised.\n\n“I cried a lot,” she said, but the tears were not out of fear — they were because she felt guilt. “I couldn’t write the news. We were witnessing these scenes from a five-star hotel.” By evening, the death toll had reached 19. On September 9th at about 3:35 pm, her outlet, the Annapurna Post's office in Tinkune, Kathmandu, was set on fire. Staff had to leave the building as parts of the newsroom burned down.\n\nWhen she knew her office was burning, she anxiously told her husband that she would resign from the job: “If we have to hide our identification cards in every protest, what kind of journalist am I?” she asked herself.\n\nShe filed a story the next day, but her emotions kept bouncing between those of a journalist bound to duty and a civilian in shock. She said that in moments like this, it’s hard to feel truly neutral.\n\nAfter watching the police beat people, she felt a strong urge to step in, not just stand back and report. The first real calm came later, when people came to the street and lit candles together in honor of those who were killed. “This was a sort of victory procession. I felt some relief after brutal days,” she said.\n\nAngad Dhakal a photojournalist who works at Kantipur National Daily, was standing outside his office building when protesters stormed in and set parts of it on fire. He had already been informed that protesters were planning to torch his office building and rushed to his office hoping to save his hard drives containing ten years of photography work. He failed.\n\nHe raised his camera and “forcefully” pressed the shutter — more to document the scene than out of “professional enthusiasm or duty.”\n\n“My office was burning. What should I photograph?” he recalled. A few moments later, a protester noticed the “PHOTO” label on his yellow Press jacket. Dhakal deflected it by saying he was an early-career freelancer and YouTuber. He went into a corner and took his jacket off so that protesters wouldn't target him.\n\nWhen it comes to covering street protests, Angad usually stands near the police because it feels safer. But on September 8th, fire and gunshots made even that area unsafe. A rubber bullet hit his friend Dipendra Dhungana, badly injuring him.\n\nHe thought, “Where do we go now? If we stay here, we’ll be hit.” After witnessing two days of protests, violence, and killings, and seeing his own office burning, he couldn't sleep for days.\n\nThe same afternoon that government buildings burned and media outlet Kantipur was attacked, a message in a protest Discord forum talked openly of “attacking Kantipur.”\n\nRumors spread to other outlets. Outside OnlineKhabar's office, where Gaurav Pokharel works, the newsroom manager said, “Very suspicious people were walking around.” They lowered blinds, avoided windows, locked the front gate, and dispersed staff to other places across the city. The outlet was threatened and effectively locked down, but not torched.\n\nPokharel hid his press ID. “ I never showed the ID card. Sometimes I had to enter the crowd shouting slogans, just to blend in among the protesters,” he said. He watched people fall under gunfire, and he helped pull one surrounded journalist out of a hostile crowd.\n\nGaurav also contributed articles to international outlets as a freelancer. Later, while transcribing an interview of a young protest organizer, he wrote to his editor at an international outlet: “This was very hard to write. I cried many times while doing it.” He had been working at a stretch for days, battling bouts of exhaustion and low blood pressure.\n\nProtesters vandalized and set fire within the Singha Darbar complex housing Nepal Television and Radio Nepal. They tried to disrupt public broadcasting.\n\nSurendra Paudyal began the day with his press ID hanging on his neck, thinking it would let him move freely. But when he reached Singha Darbar around 3:30 pm, the situation felt dangerous.\n\nHe put the ID in his pocket. When asked what mattered most, he answered without pause: life comes first. In that moment, he felt real fear and a strong duty to protect his team.\n\nHis focus narrowed to basic things: stay calm, find exits, get everyone out safely. Later, they were able to keep the 8 pm news on air through a regional link. He felt mixed emotions and a sense of relief that the broadcast continued, but also sadness and anger that their own studio had come under attack.",

    "title": "The great silence surrounding marital rape in Senegal",
    "text": "By Bowel Diop\n\nGender-based violence, including marital rape, occurs worldwide, and often, the perpetrators are the victim's husband. Marital rape is defined as an act in which one partner forces the other to engage in non-consensual sex. A report by Equality, a US-based organisation with offices in New York, Nairobi, and London, reveals that many women are affected by this phenomenon, including many in Africa.\n\nIn private online forums where women post under anonymity, distressing testimonies emerge about the violence they suffer within relationships. Out of respect and for the protection of those sharing their stories, no names or platform details are revealed. Behind these testimonies emerges a chilling reality: that of sexual relations imposed within marriage without the woman’s consent, in other words, the reality of marital rape.\n\nAs violence against women becomes increasingly common, consent is being trampled. The notion of “conjugal duty” still frequently outweighs a woman’s right to make decisions about her body.\n\nIt is in these digital spaces, where distress is voiced and violence normalized, that discussion groups take shape, embodying a form of digital sisterhood. Providing room for listening, support, and open speech, these spaces enable women to challenge together the taboos that restrict their empowerment, online as well as offline. This safe space where women share their experiences underlines the urgency of an open and courageous debate on marital rape in Africa.\n\nA cultural, religious, and legal debate\n\nIn May 2025, the program “Midi Plus” on TFM Télévision Futur Média, based in Senegal, gave national exposure to Oustaz Modou Fall, a Muslim authority in the country. This preacher claims that conjugal duty takes precedence over consent, thereby legitimizing sexual violence in the name of marriage. Speaking in Wolof, he stated:\n\nGnouni loi bi néna sakh sa diabar so beugué teud akk mom té dacoroul daga ko violé . Pfff wakhi dof ! Sa diabar ga takk ko so farata Yallah akk souna Seydouna Mohamed , touki Pape Samba dem tournage soneu baye beugu dé gnibissi beugu teud ak sokhname gnouniko bouné dama soneu damadone fobéré (rires) ga forcéko viol le. Boudé lou amm la , lane moye texte bi. Si diné.\n\nPeople say the law declares that if you force your wife to have sex, that counts as rape. Pfff — absurd, this is your wife, the one you married before God. You travel, you work, Pape Samba [the host], you come back exhausted, you want to be with your wife, and she refuses. She says she’s tired, that she was doing the housework (laughter). So if you insist, it’s rape? If that’s the case, which religious scripture says so? We must be cautious about this.\n\nThe broadcast immediately sparked indignation across social media. On TikTok, activists and legal experts mobilized. The Xam Sa Droit page published a series of videos challenging Modou Fall’s statements against existing legislation. Specifically, it points to Article 320 of Senegal’s Penal Code, which defines rape as any act of penetration “carried out through violence, coercion, threat or surprise.” This is a reminder that marriage does not take away any fundamental rights, and that refusing sex, even within a couple, remains an inalienable right. This effort at legal education was met with strong support on TikTok, as it put consent back at the center of the discussion.\n\nVoices were also raised on X. Nabou Diop Lo, a lawyer and activist for women’s and children’s rights, posted:\n\nLe viol tel que définit dans le code pénal Sénégalais ne fait pas une distinction entre le viol commis dans le ménage et celui commis hors des liens conjugaux. Tout ce qui compte c'est le consentement de la victime. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nRape, as defined in the Senegalese Penal Code, makes no distinction between rape committed within marriage and that committed outside it. What matters is the victim’s consent. https://t.co/mJcYsxZunx —Nabou Diop Lo🇸🇳 (@NabouDiopLo1) July 26, 2025\n\nBut how can a woman dare complain she's been raped when a religious figure claims that a wife’s “no” carries no weight? This dissonance between the law, public discourse, and women’s lived reality highlights the urgent need for legal reform and a clear stance from the authorities.\n\nBy normalizing marital rape, this official rhetoric entrenches an absolute claim over women’s bodies and heavily compounds the moral weight borne by potential victims.\n\nEquality Now’s 2024 report shows that the legal recognition of marital rape differs significantly across Africa. The report notes that countries such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Madagascar, Senegal, and Togo explicitly criminalize marital rape.\n\nIn countries including Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Tanzania, spouses are explicitly exempted from prosecution, except in exceptional cases.\n\nIn Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mali, Uganda, and Chad, the law remains silent on the matter, creating a complete legal void.\n\nSenegalese law on rape and paedophilia, revised in 2020, sets out the definition of rape as follows:\n\nTout acte de pénétration « commis par violence, contrainte, menace ou surprise ».\n\nAny act of penetration ‘committed by violence, coercion, threat, or surprise.’\n\nHowever, the lack of clear legal provisions on marital rape and spousal consent creates a wide scope for interpretation, often to the detriment of the victim. As a result, marital rape is often treated as an ordinary form of domestic violence, rather than classified as a criminal offence.\n\nIn Côte d’Ivoire, for example, an investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde published in February 2024 reported that a humorous TikTok video mocking women’s sexual fatigue sparked amused reactions — evidence that sexual non-consent is not taken seriously.\n\nAccording to figures published in African Health Sciences, 33 percent of women in Africa have been subjected to sexual violence at some point in their lives, with rates rising to 44 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. In Côte d’Ivoire, 40 percent of women housed in the shelter run by the NGO Akwaba Mousso say they have suffered marital rape.\n\nIn many African legal systems, including in Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire, the implicit presumption of consent between spouses prevents marital rape from being effectively recognised as a crime.\n\nWhen feminists raise awareness on the subject, the issue is frequently minimised. In the previously mentioned Le Monde article, Ivorian activist Marie-Paule Okri, co-founder of the Ivorian League for Women’s Rights, told the journalist:\n\nQuand on essaie d’en parler, on nous répond qu’on exagère. On nous inculque depuis l’adolescence que le corps de la femme est fait pour donner du plaisir à l’homme.\n\nWhen we try to talk about it, we are told we are exaggerating. From adolescence, we are taught that a woman’s body exists to give pleasure to men.\n\nYet Article 14 of the Maputo Protocol commits African states to guaranteeing women’s fundamental rights, including health and reproductive consent.\n\nBeyond legislation, it will take a deep change in attitudes to improve women’s condition, grounded in respect for their bodies and equality in relationships.",

    "title": "A region on the brink: The global implications of the war on Gaza · Global Voices",
    "text": "On October 7, 2023, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), the group that governs the Palestinian territory of Gaza, breached the barrier that has surrounded the densely populated area for the last 16 years, preventing the free flow of people and goods. The militants then launched an attack on 22 nearby Israeli settlements, towns, and military bases, killing around 1,200 civilians and soldiers and taking at least 199 hostages.\n\nMany governments around the world have condemned the attack as a war crime and act of terror, while other governments blamed Israel for setting the stage for these attacks to take place. Since then, many governments have described Israel’s response as disproportionate: the official death toll now exceeds 40,000 Palestinians killed, including over 15,000 children — some experts estimate the actual number to be over four times higher.\n\nFor more, read Global Voices’ previous Special Coverage: Israel’s war on Gaza\n\nThe assassinations of Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas Political Bureau, in Tehran on 31 July 2024, and a key Hezbollah military commander in Beirut on 30 July have significantly escalated tensions in the region. These targeted killings, combined with the failure to implement a ceasefire, are raising the risk of a war that could engulf the whole region, with potentially far-reaching consequences for global peace and stability.\n\nIsrael’s actions, including its military occupation, settlement expansion, the use of starvation as a weapon of war, and recurrent operations in Gaza and the West Bank, have drawn widespread accusations of human rights violations and defiance of international law. This includes an International Court of Justice (ICJ) initial ruling on an ongoing case finding it plausible that Israel is committing genocide and an application by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) for arrest warrants against three Hamas leaders — including Haniyeh — and two Israeli officials — including Prime Minister Netanyahu — for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nThe arrest warrants include one for Mohammed Deif, Commander-in-Chief of Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas. the Israeli army claims to have assassinated Deif in an airstrike on July 13 in the Al Mawasi humanitarian safe zone in Gaza — one that killed at least 90 people in a massacre described by United Nations official Scott Anderson as “some of the most horrific scenes I have seen in my nine months in Gaza.”\n\nIsrael's military operations and targeted assassinations in neighboring countries continue despite United Nations Security Council resolutions, global calls for a ceasefire, and repeated condemnations from international humanitarian organizations who have labeled them as violations of international humanitarian law. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has reached catastrophic levels, with an illegal blockade that has led to severe shortages of vital supplies and the threat of a poliovirus outbreak, exacerbating the suffering of the population, with nine out of 10 people internally displaced, many of them multiple times.\n\nThe international community’s failure to enforce a ceasefire or hold Israel accountable has highlighted the limitations of global institutions in managing the crises. The United Nations has failed to mediate effectively, with its resolutions ignored, and global and regional players have not put pressure on Israel to accept or implement ceasefire resolutions adopted by the UNSC or proposed by mediators. This raises significant questions about the effectiveness of international law in protecting civilians in conflict zones.\n\nIn this special coverage, we explore the regional and global implications as well as the challenges facing international law in addressing the ongoing crisis.",

    "title": "How one community in Trinidad & Tobago pushed the culinary boundaries of pigeon peas",
    "text": "By Natalie Briggs\n\nWhen I first met Florence Warrick-Joseph, there were two things I didn’t know. One, we were related in that pumpkin vine way only Caribbean people can be. Two, the doubles I had just bought from her at a pop-up market had a surprise in them.\n\nIt wasn’t the comforting warmth of a bara hot out of the box, leaking through greaseproof paper. It wasn’t the silken tear of teeth into that just-fried pillowy goodness, which, if you’re lucky, will still hold a hint of the crackle of oil.\n\nNo, it wasn’t that.\n\nIt was the filling. Cucumber, check. Sweet sauce, check. The heady bouquet of garlic, cumin and spices was there. But there was something different in the mouth feel. It wasn’t the melt-in-your-mouth consistency of the channa that makes doubles a national byword in Trinidad and Tobago. Tasty, yes … but different.\n\nThe same bouquet is heavy in Warrick-Joseph’s small kitchen, tickling the nostrils, making me think about the last time I ate. “I don’t curry the peas. I stew it,” she revealed, while demonstrating how she puts her spin on the popular street food. This is not her only departure from the norm. The peas she uses? They are pigeon peas.\n\nThese days, it isn’t quite the record scratch moment it was when it first appeared — but we’re getting ahead of ourselves. What we should be discussing is how pigeon peas, the stuff of pelau and coconut milk stew-downs, ended up in doubles. It started as an exhortation to think outside the box.\n\nIn 2014, Warrick-Joseph, a retired registered nurse, decided to do an event management course. Her lecturer asked the cohort to stretch themselves beyond the ho-hummery of birthday parties and christenings for their practicum. She was an avid planter of pigeon peas, one of the many members of the Upper Cemetery Street Residents’ Association in Diego Martin, to do so. They had a bumper crop that year.\n\n“We were walking back down the hill,” Warrick-Joseph recalled. “Me, Errol [her husband] and Mr. Timothy. And he asked what were we going to do with all these peas. My husband said, ‘We will freeze it, we will sell it.’ Because that is what people do to get money to put in the organisation. So I said, thinking out of the box, we could have a pigeon peas festival.”\n\nThe two men were sceptical. Warrick-Joseph continued, “They were like, ‘Nobody ever heard of a pigeon peas festival.’ I said, ‘I’ve heard of a mango festival. I’ve heard of a breadfruit festival. There’s a chocolate festival. Why not pigeon peas?’”\n\nThe stage was set, but the main players were yet to arrive. They had the peas, but it would literally take a village to showcase their versatility. By the time the first festival rolled around in 2015, it was a result of a true community effort. They were able to generate so many recipes, including a version of doubles, that there were enough to fill a commemorative book.\n\n“We got someone to do pholourie,” Warrick-Joseph said. “We got somebody who could do pigeon peas accra. Everybody ended up taking a recipe. We found people in the community who could do these things. The pigeon peas roti was from a woman who did roti, and instead of using the dhal with the split peas, she used the pigeon peas.”\n\nPholourie? Accra? Roti? It wasn’t such a stretch of the imagination. After all, pigeon peas’ nutty, earthy flavour lends itself well to a variety of savoury preparations. That’s why it’s a perennial favourite across the Caribbean.\n\nBut Warrick-Joseph was about to hit me another curveball. That first festival, she came up with four of her own recipes. One for ice cream. One for a punch. One for a pigeon peas wine. Then one for a liqueur. Two of those are sweet. One of them officially qualifies as dessert. The trick was in picking, shelling and stewing the fresh pigeon peas to form the custard base all within 24 hours, while they were still full of flavour. My mind had more difficulty wrapping around the idea of pigeon peas as this creamy, cold concoction.\n\nThere were no such problems with the muffins. As I stood and watched her prepare them, different scents filled the kitchen, this time with her signature spice blend. It was the spice, I realised, that gave it the illusion of being sweet. I hadn’t seen her put a lot of sugar into the mixture. The eventual result was dense, reminding me more of a coconut drop than the traditional muffin with its cakey crumb. Fresh out of the oven, breaking into one was a treat; I could smell the spices wafting up from the steamy centre. There was nutmeg. Some cinnamon, too.\n\nNothing in the flavour screamed pigeon peas. That was more in the texture and the solidity with which it sat in my stomach. One muffin felt like a full meal, which led me to ask about the nutritional benefits of the pigeon peas substitution. I found out that, among other things, they were high in potassium and fibre, and were good for gut flora, diabetics, and women who wanted to lose weight.\n\nIn fact, it was trying to cater to customers who wanted healthier alternatives to doubles that prompted Warrick-Joseph to come up with a recipe for gluten-free bara, made with pigeon pea flour: “The reason for the switch was that people felt they wanted gluten-free. There was a group of people that was intolerant to normal flour.”\n\nThese were what I had really come to see her prepare, the muffins being a delectable side journey. I knew it would be different from the first doubles I had from her, since the bara in that one had been made the regular way, with flour, leavening agent and oil. How different this version would be, both in taste and feel, was left to be seen.\n\nIt was a three-flour mix, including the ground pigeon peas, which resulted in a tacky, sticky sort of dough that was allowed to rest for about half an hour. While it did that, Warrick-Joseph warmed the oil in which she would fry them later, and prepared the pigeon peas filling. We talked about many things while she did this, including her business and her plans to eventually have pre-packaged products in the supermarket.\n\nWhen she deemed the dough ready, she put the peas aside. The low gluten content made it difficult to handle as it tears easily, which is why she prefers to use a pastelle press to shape them, instead of rolling them out the traditional way. From there, the perfect circles went into the warmed oil, where they puff up slightly — nothing like the regular bara, because of the low gluten content. By the time they are done, I’m itching to try them.\n\nWarrick-Joseph presented them to me on a plate, complete with pigeon peas filling, cucumber and a tangy tamarind sweet sauce. I took a bite, and chewed slowly, trying to make up my mind about them. The verdict? All the elements were there. This tasted like doubles. Purists might draw the line at the bara, which was more reminiscent of a soft taco shell — flatter, with a slight, mealy crunch to it — while health enthusiasts might hail it as the thing to make doubles great again.",

    "title": "Meet Esther, an independent journalist reporting from the frontlines of Myanmar",
    "text": "Exile Hub is one of Global Voices’ partners in Southeast Asia, emerging in response to the 2021 coup in Myanmar, focusing on empowering journalists and human rights defenders. This edited article is republished under a content partnership agreement.\n\nMost people spend their lives running away from danger. Esther ran toward it.\n\nAfter finding refuge in Australia under UNHCR protection, she made the bold decision to return to the Thailand–Myanmar border in 2023 to continue her journalism. Now, in 2025, she reports from one of Myanmar’s most dangerous conflict zones often under fire, often uncertain of tomorrow. Yet she remains unshaken.\n\nIn a world where silence is safe, Esther chooses the frontline. Her weapon is truth, and she wields it for those who cannot.\n\nA journey against the current\n\nBorn in Mon State in 1993, Esther has always been someone who could not ignore injustice.\n\n“I have never been able to lie to myself or live in misery. If something doesn’t sit right with me, I have to face it head-on,” she reflects.\n\nLike many young people in Myanmar, Esther initially wandered through different jobs, unsure of her calling. She translated movies, worked as a travel and tour sales representative, and later became a public relations officer at a Korean company. But none of these roles felt right.\n\n“I couldn’t stay where I felt trapped or compromised,” she shares.\n\nHer turning point came in 2018 when she attended a basic journalism course. “That’s when I realized writing and sharing opinions was what I had always loved. It felt like home.” After the course ended, she landed her first journalism job at an ethnic media house.\n\nWhen the coup changed everything\n\nBy 2021, Esther was working with a major media house. When the coup hit, her newsroom relocated to Karenni State, and Esther went with them, continuing to report under dangerous conditions. But even after escaping to Australia for safety, the pull of truth was stronger than comfort. In 2023, she made the decision to return.\n\nA few months after she arrived in Thailand, the military made a desperate announcement. In February 2024, the military reactivated its conscription law, mandating that men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 serve in the army. Evading service or helping someone evade could lead to five years in prison.\n\n“As the number of these conscription stories grew, so did my determination to report them,” Esther recalls. But working as an exiled independent journalist came with its own struggles. With no regular income and the constant need for resources, continuing her work was a challenge. That’s when she applied for Exile Hub’s Critical Voices Fellowship 2024 and received it.\n\nBearing witness on the frontlines\n\nEsther began collecting stories from those most affected. She spoke with young men who had fled their villages, fearful of being conscripted. She also interviewed women who had watched brothers and husbands taken by the army, leaving families uncertain and anxious about their loved ones’ fate.\n\nIn September 2024, she published “I Don’t Want Others to Face What I Faced: Stories of Forced Military Conscription,” giving a voice to those the regime wanted silenced.\n\nLater, she followed with another hard-hitting piece, “Snatched from Their Beds, Taken on the Streets — The Young Men in Myanmar Forced to Fight the Junta’s Losing War.”\n\nToday, Esther works deep inside one of Myanmar’s most volatile conflict zones, a place where the sound of gunfire and the threat of airstrikes are constant. Despite the risks, she is satisfied with witnessing the truth with her eyes and documenting and reporting on it.\n\nEsther is more than a journalist. She is a lifeline for those whose cries would otherwise vanish in the dark. And no matter the risk, she will keep writing and keep reporting, because for her, silence is never an option.",

    "text": "Environmental groups initiated global activities and protests from September 18 to 21 to drumbeat the call for urgent climate action amid the worsening pollution and continuing deterioration of the natural ecosystem. The series of protests were held right before the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and less than six weeks away from the UN Climate Summit (COP30) in Brazil.\n\nIn Asia, the “Draw the Line” campaign highlighted the demand to phase out fossil fuels, build renewables, shift to sustainable food, and prioritize the people’s basic needs over corporate interests.\n\nSeveral countries participated in the campaign led by a network of environmental groups and community-based organizations.\n\nIn the Philippines, the campaign was actively supported by local groups resisting projects and policies that threaten the lives and livelihoods of rural and coastal communities. A fluvial protest was organized in the town of Culasi in Antique province, located in the Visayas islands of the Philippines, to call attention to the demand of the small fisherfolk against the entry of commercial fishing operations in municipal waters. Javie Barcinal of 350.org Asia echoed the stand of small fishers.\n\nSmall fishers are among the worst affected by the climate crisis, with warming seas resulting in dwindling catches each year. To make matters worse, the government has allowed industrial fishing to encroach into municipal waters. This exacerbates climate injustice that small fishers experience as hunger for their families.\n\nIn Indonesia, environmnetalists organized at least 36 actions in 34 cities and provinces across the country on September 18, to push for bold reforms in government policies. A march was held towards the State Palace on September 19 as rallyists reiterated the anti-corruption demands of the youth-led protests that erupted in the country last month. Sisilia Nurmala Dewi of 350.org Indonesia led climate advocates in asserting an end to corruption to fund a better future.\n\nWe draw the line as flash floods drown the innocent, while people’s voices against government failures are being silenced. Oligarchs and polluters have ruled this country for far too long, taking public money for climate action and destroying natural resources that should be preserved for future generations. We demand real, decisive action. President Prabowo must honor his promises by committing to 100 percent renewable energy in 10 years and a clear immediate plan to phase-out coal plants.\n\nPaskah Toga of Climate Rangers Bali cited the recent flooding disaster in Bali island to rally public opposition against fossil-based power plants.\n\nThe recent deadly floods in Bali is clear evidence that the climate crisis is no longer a distant threat but a reality that needs to be resolved with concrete policies. The government must stop building fossil-based power plants and phase out fossil fuels.\n\nIn Japan, protesters challenged the new leadership to phase out fossil fuels and to reverse policies that blame immigrants for the country’s social woes. Masayoshi Iyoda, 350.org Japan campaigner, summed up their demand.\n\nWe draw the line on Japan’s rising contributions to climate chaos and war. As we experience both flash floods and extreme heat, workers suffer and food prices continue to soar. Japan’s new leadership must show political will to phase out fossil fuels and shift to 100% renewables, instead of going with the far-right tide of blaming immigrants for our economic woes and backsliding on climate action.\n\nThe protest was also attended by activists who expressed solidarity with Palestinians by condemning the continuous bombings and military attacks in Gaza.\n\nIn South Korea, Jiyun Gim of the Green Environment Youth Korea urged authorities to comply with the planned emissions reduction this year.\n\nSouth Korea’s 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) will be determined in November. We are drawing the line to prevent South Korea from setting a climate goal that falls below 60% emissions reduction. This is not just about numbers—it is the survival line for future generations. The government must set ambitious, science-based, and future-oriented climate targets.\n\nIn Cox’s Bazaar, Bangladesh, community residents staged an action denouncing the planned revival of a coal plant. Shahrukh Karim, a youth leader in Matarbari, articulated the sentiments of the local community.\n\nWe are burning, our lands are dying, and our rivers are drying up. We draw the line on building another coal plant, when the existing one has already driven away thousands of families and turned our homes into a wasteland. This needs to stop.\n\nCommunities Draw the Line on Matarbari Coal Plant 2 Revival https://t.co/2IT1VPkF5P pic.twitter.com/9E05xBK9xV — Energy & Power (@enpbd) September 20, 2025\n\nIn an email interview with Global Voices, 350.org Asia Communications Manager Ilang-Ilang Quijano shared their initial plans on how to sustain the campaign.",

    "title": "Africa charts bold path towards green inclusive development at the second Africa Climate Summit",
    "text": "Over 6,000 delegates gathered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, for the second Africa Climate Summit (ACS2), held from September 8 to 10, to search for Africa-driven solutions ahead of negotiations for the United Nations 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30), the world's largest annual environmental conference.\n\nThe second Africa Climate Summit was organized to unite African leaders, youth, and partners in pushing for fair climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s role as a solutions hub, while preparing a common position ahead of COP30 negotiations. It was a pivotal moment for Africa to stake its claim as a leader in the global climate conversation. Leaders, activists, and young innovators came together to push for reforms in climate finance, stronger adaptation strategies, and recognition of Africa’s youth voices. The gathering was themed around “Accelerating Global Climate Solutions: Financing for Africa’s Resilient and Green Development.” Ethiopia’s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, opened the event with a keynote that set the tone:\n\nAfrica should not be seen only as a victim of climate challenges, but as a continent of solutions and innovations that could guide the world forward.\n\nHe also proposed the “Africa Climate Innovation Compact” to produce 1,000 innovators by 2030, financed and owned by Africans.\n\nThis vision was built on the momentum of the inaugural summit in Nairobi in 2023, which, importantly, was preceded by the African Youth Climate Assembly (AYCA). By doing so, organizers ensured that the majority-youth population of Africa was not just represented but central to shaping the conversation.\n\nThe challenges Africa faces\n\nAfrica continues to wrestle with the painful legacy of historical injustice and the harsh reality of a deepening climate crisis. Despite contributing the least to global emissions, the continent feels the impacts most acutely. Climate finance remains painfully inadequate as wealthy nations have consistently fallen short of their yearly pledge, and African countries today pay back about five times more in debt servicing than they receive in climate aid.\n\nThe cost of this imbalance is causing hospitals to stretch beyond capacity as diseases like malaria and cholera spread more widely under shifting climatic conditions. Crops are failing under the weight of prolonged droughts or sudden floods, leaving farmers with empty fields and families without food. Coastal cities, from Lagos to Dar es Salaam, face rising waters that sweep away homes, businesses, and livelihoods.\n\nYet at the same time, Africa holds some of the richest renewable resources on the planet. If harnessed, its solar capacity alone could power the world many times over. Africa holds 17 percent of the world’s population but receives just 3 percent of global climate investment. Restrictive financial systems and predatory loan arrangements often force African countries back into reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nEcoVista, a youth-led ecological justice movement whose main focus is on climate justice and the environment, based in Nairobi, Kenya posted on its X account:\n\nFossil fuels are the biggest driver of the climate crisis, responsible for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions. #MakeThemPay\n\nDraw The Line pic.twitter.com/N9aUDWl8e8 — EcoVistaKe (@EcoVistaKE) September 19, 2025\n\nLayered on top of that is a painful reminder of colonial history. While Africa’s minerals powered industrial growth in the Global North, the continent was left behind with ecological damage and struggling economies. Yearly natural disasters including cyclones, floods, and expanding deserts displace millions every year, and pushed African leaders at ACS2 to adopt the Addis Ababa Declaration, a clear and urgent call for change.\n\nWith regard to the consequences facing Africa, Tangwa Abilu, a Cameroonian Climate and Environmental Activist, shared on X :\n\nThe horn of Africa is grieving because their\n\n-Their farms are no longer yielding\n\n-Advancement of desert is alarming\n\n-Our major rivers are drying\n\n-Proliferation of pest and pathogens\n\n-Development of tropical diseases.\n\n-Our crop are dieing out.\n\nClimate change is a reality. pic.twitter.com/2MQ5fZG1Zo — Tangwa Abilu.🌿🌏🌾🍀🍃.SDG's. (@AbiluTangwa) December 29, 2024\n\nIn the same context, K. Diallo, an African author, drew attention to the damage caused by floods in December 2023. He posted on his X account:\n\nflood disaster in the DR Congo is a result of global warming meeting a failed state…..The global South bears more than 95% of the costs and deaths related to climate change despite making up less than 5% of consumption-based cumulative emissions above 350ppm CO2. pic.twitter.com/vTDobNNVl5 — K.Diallo ☭ (@nyeusi_waasi) December 31, 2023\n\nDemands ahead of COP30\n\nFor African leaders, climate finance must shift from symbolic promises to meaningful reparations. They argue that financing should come as debt-free grants rather than loans that deepen dependency. Historic polluters owe this to frontline communities losing their farms to drought or their homes to rising seas. The Loss and Damage Fund, in particular, needs to prioritize these vulnerable communities with direct, rapid assistance: cash for families in sinking villages, support for starved farmlands, and investment in healthcare for climate-induced trauma. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said:\n\nToo often, Africa's story begins with what we lack: finance, technology, time. Let us instead begin with what we have: the youngest population in the world, vast solar resources, and the resilience to build a new climate economy.\n\nLeaders are also demanding stronger commitments from rich nations. During last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries from the global north pledged to pay USD300 billion in climate finance, but the amount falls far short of the USD1.3 trillion per year needed by African nations, who need it to effectively adapt and transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nACS2 came at a crucial moment when the Lake Chad Basin, which once supported millions across Cameroon, Chad, and the Central African Republic, had shrunk by over 90 percent. With it, the livelihoods of countless families have evaporated. Africa is both the most vulnerable to climate collapse and one of the most promising centers for climate solutions. As the world heads towards COP30 in Brazil in November, Africans say they do not just want to be heard, but are demanding to be recognized as solution builders and shapers of the planet’s shared future.",

    "title": "The legacy of ‘sponge cities’ left by Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian",
    "text": "Yu Kongjian (俞孔坚), 62, the Chinese landscape architect who pioneered the concept of “sponge cities,” died in a plane crash in the Pantanal region, the largest tropical wetland in the world, in Brazil, on September 23, 2025. Three other people also died during the accident: pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, and filmmakers Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., who were both working with Yu to create a documentary about sponge cities. The cause of the crash is under investigation.\n\nFerraz’s work focused on nonfiction productions, including a series about the 2016 plane crash involving the Brazilian football team, Chapecoense. Crispim Jr. worked on projects such as a documentary about Brazilian architect Vilanova Artigas and another about the first women’s football national team in Brazil.\n\nBrazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, posted condolences on his X account and highlighted Yu's work:\n\nFoi com tristeza e consternação que recebi a notícia do desastre aéreo ocorrido no Pantanal no início da noite desta terça-feira, 23. A tragédia, infelizmente, custou as vidas do piloto Marcelo Pereira de Barros, dos documentaristas Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz e Rubens… — Lula (@LulaOficial) September 24, 2025\n\nIt was with sadness and consternation that I received the news about the aircraft disaster that happened in the Pantanal regional, early Tuesday night, the 23rd. The tragedy, unfortunately, took the lives of the pilot Marcelo Pereira de Barros, documentarians Luiz Fernando Feres da Cunha Ferraz and Rubens Crispim Jr., and the Chinese architect Kongjian Yu. In times of climate change, Kongjian Yu became a world reference for sponge cities, which unite life quality and environment protection: something we want — and need — for the future. To all the victims’ friends, family and coworkers, I leave my deepest sorrows.\n\nYu’s legacy\n\nYu was in Brazil to work on a documentary, but he had also recently attended the São Paulo International Architecture Biennale, which was themed “EXTREMES — Architectures for an overheated planet.” Raquel Schenkman, the Institute of Brazilian Architects’ president, responsible for the Biennale’s organization, told G1 Yu was “someone on the frontline of transformations in big urban centers facing climate change.”\n\nOn its website, the Biennale published a note saying that, as the “creator of the theory of sponge cities, Yu Kongjian left a monumental legacy, also urgent to face climate crisis in cities,” and that his work, based on ecosystemic principles, “showed in a practical and poetic way how the landscape can be a vital infrastructure to urban resilience, integrating man to nature in a sustainable way.”\n\nSponge cities concept\n\nYu’s main legacy is designing and implementing projects based on his sponge cities theory. A professor at Peking University, his “sponge city” concept became a top national priority in China in 2013, following the massive floods in the Beijing region in 2012, which left 79 people dead and tens of thousands displaced. He also founded Turenscape, one of the main landscape architecture firms in the world, based in China.\n\nYu cautioned against overly “grey” cities that rely too much on concrete and asphalt, which disrupt natural water pathways and prevent the ground from absorbing water. While conventional water management focuses on draining water through engineered drainage infrastructure, such as pipes and water channels, sponge cities rely on techniques such as green roofs, rainwater storage and infiltration systems, sunken green spaces, permeable pavement, bioretention ponds, wetland revitalization, restoring natural waterflow pathways, and more.\n\n“Floods are not enemies,” Yu explained in an interview with WeForum. “We can make friends with floods. We can make friends with water.”\n\nYu’s approach to urban planning has been successfully implemented in dozens of cities in China, particularly after Chinese President Xi Jinping established his thoughts on ecological civilization in 2018.\n\nIn the past decade, his natural landscape approach is becoming an important tool in city planning and water management around the world.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, where recurring extreme weather events routinely cause massive floods that displace hundreds of thousands, many city planners are looking to sponge cities as a potential solution for unprecedented levels of rainfall.\n\nSo far, the concept has mostly been implemented on a small scale in individual neighborhoods, streets, or areas, meaning its flood mitigation impacts are often limited to the local level, rather than city- or nationwide.\n\nOn X, Zhongshan city's tourism promotion outlet, commemorates Yu's death by highlighting one of his landscape projects in the southern Chinese city:\n\nOn September 23 (Brazilian time), Professor Yu Kongjian from the College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at #Peking University, tragically passed away in a plane crash at the age of 62. Professor Yu had won numerous world-class #design awards, including the Oberlander Prize and the John Cobb Common Good Award. Among his representative works is the #QijiangPark in #Zhongshan, #Guangdong . This #park, transformed from the site of a former shipyard, opened in 2001 and quickly gained global attention, winning several domestic and international design awards. In designing and building the park, Professor Yu and his team preserved the original industrial relics, such as shipyard machinery, docks, and other structures, and repurposed them with new functions. [original English version from @Amzhongshan]\n\nYu himself acknowledged that scaling up the pilot projects in Chinese cities was challenging. One of his sponge city projects in Zhengzhou faced backlash after a severe flood in 2021, which claimed 12 lives in the city, prompting many to express doubts about the practicality of his idea. Moreover, as China's coastal regions are highly industrialized, they demand cross-departmental collaboration, strong political will, and extensive administrative coordination to restore concrete riverbanks and seawalls to wetlands.\n\nIn an interview with Brazilian news outlet G1, Yu said that on a scale of 1 to 10, his optimism regarding the world’s chances of reversing climate change ranked 4. He also mentioned water scarcity — one of the challenges his projects aimed to address — as the primary issue humanity will face over the next 25 years.\n\nA journalist living in China, Isabela Shi, shared Yu Kongjian’s last update on a Chinese social media platform:\n\n🕯️No último vídeo que o arquiteto chinês Yu Kongjian divulgou na rede social chinesa, ele estava mostrando a viagem a Pantanal com equipa brasileira que tenta refletir sobre Planeta Esponja através de encolhimento de zonas húmidas. “Wonderful, amazing”, encantou ele pro Brasil. pic.twitter.com/fKn5ZKgIwe — Isabela Shi🇨🇳🇧🇷 (@ShiIsabela) September 25, 2025",

    "title": "How a comics school taught perseverance and creative freedom in Bosnia & Herzegovina",
    "text": "This article by Adin Kadrić first appeared in Balkan Diskurs on September 12, 2025. An edited version is being republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement with the Post-Conflict Research Center (PCRC).\n\nEditor's note: Zenica is a city in the middle of Bosnia and Herzegovina with about 100,000 residents. It is noted for its ironworks industry as well as being home to one of the big prisons in ex-Yugoslavia, described in the cult rock song Zenica Blues. It is not often considered when speaking about art, making the significance of this initiative — which began during the war of 1992-1995 and still persists to this day — even more extraordinary.\n\nFor over 30 years, the Zenica School of Comics has been not only an illustration school but a symbol of perseverance, cultural resistance, and lasting dedication to art. Initially conceived as an escape from the repression of the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and later, a platform for expression and creativity, the school has trained around 200 young artists. About 70 of them have gone on to become prominent young authors, whose works have left a mark on the domestic and regional comics scene.\n\nSeveral graduates are even acclaimed beyond the borders of their country, with Kenan Halilović, Biljana Šafaražik, and Zdravko Cvjetković being some of the most prominent. While the school has been synonymous with quality and creativity within the domestic comic scene for years, the international acclaim for these artists’ work underscores the fact that Zenica maintains a firm foothold in this visual medium.\n\nRecalling its beginnings, Adnadin Jašarević, the school’s founder and director of the Zenica City Museum, said that its primary goal was to give children a creative escape from the harsh realities of war. Under such conditions, comics were like Alice in Wonderland — providing an escape from hunger, fear, and shelling. An average of ten students still pass through the school every year, learning how to translate their thoughts, fears, and hopes into dynamic sequences of frames and speech clouds.\n\nNewer names like Filip Andronik, Milorad Vicanović, Senad Mavrić, and Enis Čišić represent the contemporary wave of comic artists from BiH. They actively cooperate with renowned publishers from the United States and Europe, demonstrating that despite its underdeveloped infrastructure, Bosnia and Herzegovina has comic creators who can stand equally alongside the best talent the genre has to offer.\n\nPublications such as “Horostop,” “ZE strip,” “EKO strip” and “SUV – Steps in Time” were created at the Zenica School, showcasing both its longevity and its dedication to comic culture. Explaining that the students themselves choose the topics they work on according to their own interests, Jašarević noted that he has “never stopped working” to ensure that comics remain a tool for expression and creative release.\n\nAs far as technology’s impact on the comic industry goes, Jašarević explained that while comics used to be widely available to the masses, they are now becoming a far more exclusive product, with expensive integral editions and albums intended for a small but loyal audience. While the idea behind ​​comics as a liberating medium remains the same, the development of technology has heralded a turn in modern-day comic production.\n\nCartoonist and former Zenica student Zdravko Cvjetković, in speaking about the impact of technology, emphasized that smart tablets have made drawing easier and faster for many artists, without compromising the quality of their work. However, he warned that AI tools — such as those used for generating text and images — pose serious ethical and aesthetic questions.\n\nHe believes that the mass availability of tools that produce images and stories in seconds, threatens to trivialize art and blur the line between creativity and automation: “If we all become artists just because we have a tool in our pocket, then nobody is really an artist.”\n\nMany things about comics today, according to Cvjetković, are drastically different than before the war: “Comics are no longer accessible to such a wide audience, especially children. They’re too expensive and rarely found in newsstands.”\n\nThe burgeoning Bosnian comics scene\n\nPointing out that children today reach for screens before print media like comics or books, Cvjetković said that publishers are therefore targeting older generations who grew up with comics.\n\nA positive outcome of this is the growing number of comics festivals in the region, which promote a culture of reading and drawing. “Workshops and comics contests for children [are] an almost mandatory part of every serious festival,” Cvjetković emphasized, “and this is crucial in the absence of comics schools like the one in Zenica.”\n\nComics culture in Bosnia and Herzegovina persists despite its modest ecosystem, in which there is almost no institutional support, and few major publishers or specialized festivals. However, thanks to the enthusiasm of individuals, the scene is not disappearing; in fact, it is quietly but steadily growing.\n\nAuthors like Berin Tuzlić and Enis Čišić have been representing BiH on the regional and international comics scene for years. Tuzlić, known for his experimental approach and multimedia projects, combines comics with music and animation. Čišić, who also tried his hand at Marvel productions, represents a more contemporary, technically precise form of expression. Their work shows that the country is producing talent capable of competing globally.\n\nIsmet Erdić also holds a special place on the BiH comics scene, with his rare combination of historical storytelling and visual narration in comics about Kulin Ban and medieval Bosnia. His work has educational value and is often used in classrooms, which makes him one of the few authors whose comics reach the general public.\n\nDespite unfavorable conditions for comic distribution, publicity, and marketing, comics culture in BiH is still preserved as a niche interest by enthusiasts. Social networks, web comics, and regional cooperation with authors from Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia are currently key to their survival. So, while relatively small, the BiH comics scene has an authentic flair and great potential, waiting for better times ahead.",

    "title": "Civil society initiative fights for equal education opportunities in Togo",
    "text": "In Togo, a national initiative built on civic solidarity helps relieve parents’ yearly back-to-school expenses.\n\nEducation is free and compulsory throughout the country, with a population of over 9.5 million. Following a two-month break (from mid-July to mid-September), more than 3 million students returned to school this month. While the authorities continue to work on improving education through teacher training and recruitment, investing in renovations and school infrastructure, the parents’ main priority is seeing their children succeed at the end of each school year.\n\nOver the years, there has been a marked increase in the gross enrollment rate and the proportion of Togolese students completing the school year. In April 2025, the local news website Lechiquier published:\n\n…le taut brut de scolarisation au primaire dépasse 100%. Il était de l’ordre de 111,70% en 2023, 116,70% en 2024 et une prévision de 116,20% pour l’année 2025. Dans le même sillage, le taux d’achèvement du primaire a évolué de 88,80% en 2023 à 94,60% en 2024. Pour l’année 2025, le gouvernement table sur une augmentation de 121,70%.\n\nThe gross primary school enrolment rate now exceeds 100 percent. In 2023, it was approximately 111.70 percent, in 2024 it was 116.70 percent, and 116.20 percent is forecast for 2025. Similarly, the primary school completion rate increased from 88.80 percent in 2023 to 94.60 percent in 2024. For 2025, the government forecasts an increase to 121.70 percent.\n\nThis rate of over 100 percent is due to it far exceeding the initial estimated value.\n\nFree school education\n\nTogo is one of five African countries with high enrollment rates in school, an impressive development stemming from the various reforms the authorities have implemented in the education sector. In 2008, Togo introduced free pre-school and primary education in the public sector. Since the beginning of the 2021–2022 school year, education in public secondary schools has also been free, a measure the authorities will maintain for the 2025–2026 school year.\n\nThese measures help combat inequities in accessing education. However, efforts, such as providing student school kits (notebooks, books, pens, pencils, erasers, pencil sharpeners, and school bags), are still required to tackle inequality and ensure universal coverage.\n\nTogo’s guaranteed monthly minimum wage (SMIG) increased from FCFA 35,000 (USD 64) in 2012 to FCFA 52,500 (USD 95) in early 2023. Although this measure was introduced to support the Togolese working population of over 4 million, not all are content with its implementation, condemning the country’s ongoing poor economic situation and challenging living conditions.\n\nAssociation contributions\n\nGiven the financial crisis, parents’ biggest concern is purchasing back-to-school supplies and kits. However, Togolese civil society provides solutions. Citizens, both young and old, are quick to lend their support to help parents meet these expenses.\n\nNumerous citizens, working as part of various associations, travel to the country’s villages and remote areas, assisting and supporting children, especially the most vulnerable. These efforts are a social and solidarity-based alternative to the associations committed to child protection, education, and development.\n\nOne example is Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (the Togolese Child Protection Association or LTPE). On August 29, 2025, LTPE supported 5,000 children from 12 villages of the Amou Prefecture in the Plateaux region.\n\nLe 29 août 2025, plus de 5 000 enfants de la préfecture d’Amou venus de 12 localités différentes ont reçu des kits scolaires grâce à l’initiative « Éducation pour tous : 1 élève, 1 kit, 1 choix de vie » portée par la #LTPE. pic.twitter.com/LMroVuE9oY — Ligue Togolaise pour la Protection de l'Enfance (@LTPE_ONG) August 30, 2025\n\nOn August 29, 2025, more than 5,000 children from 12 different locations in the Amou Prefecture received school kits through the #LTPE initiative ‘Education for All: One student, one kit, one life choice.’\n\nIn an interview with Togolese media outlet Plume d'Afrique, Nina Afi Kazoulé, the LTPE coordinator, explained the scope of this measure:\n\nNous voulons par cette action éviter le décrochage scolaire. Et nous savons que le décrochage scolaire peut être dû à l'incapacité financière des parents, aux grossesses en milieu scolaire, bref à tous les comportements qui ne sont pas appropriés à adopter par un apprenant.\n\nWe want to prevent school dropouts with this measure. We know that school dropouts can happen due to the parents’ lack of financial resources, pregnancies among school girls, or any inappropriate student behavior\n\nIn the village of Zooti N'titikope, Vogan, a town 45 kilometers northwest of the Togolese capital Lomé, the Togovi Bé Sourire association and Action for Peace and Good Governance (APGG) joined forces with several other associations on September 5 and 6 to support young learners. More than 300 vulnerable children received school kits, and 20 young girls will be monitored and supported in successfully reintegrating into school.\n\nLomé also has vulnerable children supported by other groups, including the Premiers Pas pour l’Enfance (First Steps for Children or 3PE) association. Its mission is to promote equal education opportunities through solidarity initiatives, such as the payment of school fees and supply provision for children. Association President Akilou Demon told media outlet Ledefenseur:\n\nNous voulons que tous les enfants aient accès à l’éducation, car l’enfant a droit à l’école. Si certains en sont privés, ce n’est pas juste. Notre ambition est de leur donner une chance égale de réussir et de contribuer demain au développement de notre patrie.\n\nAs children have the right to attend school, we want all children to have access to education. Some are deprived, and this is not fair. We aim to give them equal opportunities to succeed and one day contribute to our country’s development.\n\nAlthough the results of various reforms are visible, shortcomings remain in Togo’s education system.\n\nSchool infrastructure, such as classrooms, is substandard, especially in villages. Students study in straw huts with few school benches (supplemented in some places with bricks) and are forced to move or interrupt their lessons due to adverse weather conditions. In 2021, these circumstances led to construction plans for 30,000 classrooms equipped with wooden class benches. However, in September 2024, the government reduced its improvement projects by more than half, going from 30,000 classrooms to just 14,632.\n\nWhile civil society can offset some of the education system’s shortcomings, it’s ultimately up to the state, which declared education free and compulsory, to improve education quality and train new teachers to achieve equal opportunities for all Togolese children.",

    "title": "In Brazil, Romani people living in peripheral areas fight for recognition of their identities",
    "text": "This article, written by Artur Ferreira and Amanda Oliveira, was originally published on May 30, 2025, on the Agência Mural website. An edited version is published on Global Voices as part of a partnership agreement.\n\nIn the collective imagination, the Romani people are associated with colourful clothing, parties, accessories, and an aura of mystery, embodying a wandering spirit. But beyond the stereotypes, there is a rich history of resistance and belonging that spans centuries, including in Brazil, in the outskirts of São Paulo.\n\nIn universities, public offices, doctors’ offices, or their traditional campsites, they are fighting for their rights, against prejudice, and for recognition in a country where there are still shortcomings in caring for the diversity of these communities.\n\nIn Itaim Paulista, a neighbourhood at the eastern end of the city, 250 people live in one of the main and oldest Romani campsites in the region.\n\n“Some Romanies palm read, dance, get dressed up in traditional clothing, but some are even evangelical, like myself, and they don’t all even live in camps. We are a people like any other,” the 32-year-old housewife Magda Santos says. She has been living in the camps for eight years with her husband and two children. “I am not Romani by blood, but I became one when I got married to one.”\n\nThe Romani, also known as the Roma peoples, are an ethnic group that doesn’t have a single origin. One of the more widely accepted theories is that they are of Indian origin but have travelled the world since the 11th century in a great diaspora, dispersing throughout the Balkans, Western Europe, and later to other continents.\n\nWhile she was hanging clothes on the clothesline, 29-year-old seamstress Viviane Alves Pereira made sure to find an answer when asked about the main problems her people face. The statement came without hesitation: prejudice, invisibility and the lack of access to basic rights, a common scenario in marginalized neighbourhoods.\n\nWho are the Roma people from the outskirts?\n\nThe majority of Romani who live on the outskirts of Greater São Paulo are of the Calon ethnicity, like Magda and Viviane. They are also those who suffer the most prejudice relating to maintaining their traditions and being most recognized as “gypsies” (a term now considered derogatory), because of their clothing and their nomadic lifestyle, according to sources from this report.\n\nIn Brazil, there are two other Romani ethnic groups: the Roma and the Sinti peoples. They don’t wear traditional clothing, so they mostly go unnoticed in the cities.\n\n“Many Brazilians were already cared for by doctors, nurses and Romani lawyers, and maybe they don’t even know,” states activist Nicolas Ramanush, 64, who is the president of the NGO, Romani Embassy of Brazil (Embaixada Cigana do Brasil), in Santo André in the Greater São Paulo area.\n\n“In the region, Romani people were concentrated in the neighborhood of Itaim Paulista and in the cities of Itaquaquecetuba and Itapevi, with camps near the train stations,” he says.\n\nEach ethnicity is divided into subgroups, and each one develops its own customs, habits, religions and rituals. “In my ethnic group, for example, we always wear decorated shoes with a lot of details. Some Calon women are famous for their flowery dresses and for using handkerchiefs,” says Ramanush, who belongs to the Sinti ethnicity.\n\nThis group has the fewest number of people in the country. “Today, if there are 100 families in Brazil, it is a lot,” says Ramanush. “This is because of the period of Nazism. The Sintis were almost exterminated. Among the Romani killed during the Holocaust, the majority were Sinti and Roma,” he adds.\n\nRamanush notes that many aspects of Romani culture are integrated into the Brazilian lifestyle without most people realizing it. They were among those responsible for helping Carnival to grow, especially in the northeast, creating Carnival street blocks. Certain costumes, such as “La Ursa” (The Bear) in Recife, have a Romani origin.\n\n“Instruments like the seven or six-string guitar were brought to Brazil by the Roma people. Some samba dancers spoke about how living with the Romanies inspired them musically,” Ramanush says.\n\nUnder the canvas tents\n\nNomadic and outskirt-dwelling Romani have a routine defined by difficulties surrounding education for their children and lack of healthcare, caused by the lack of a stable address. They also face São Paulo’s structural problems, such as floods, and living under canvas tents, without safety.\n\nOne of the most impactful natural disasters was the flooding in February 2025 in the far east of São Paulo, in the region known as Jardim Pantanal. The streets and houses remained underwater for several days. The Romani in these camps had to face that situation under the tents.\n\n“We spent days underwater, and it was the neighbors from the region who helped us,” Santos remembers with outrage.\n\nThe camp’s inhabitants had to deal with a lack of drinking water; tents were affected, and according to local accounts, they had to make a joint effort to avoid major losses of furniture and appliances while the flooding advanced.\n\nJust like Santos, Ramanush believes that the first step to improving the Romani community’s life in the outskirts of Brazil is for them not to be invisible.\n\nPrejudice and invisibility\n\nEven with initiatives such as the National Day of Roma Peoples, commemorated every May 24 since 2006, some rights are still neglected. For example, Romani people are not recognized in the national census of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).\n\nSantos remembers the difficulty she faced in registering her children’s ethnic group in their identity documents. Since there is no official recognition of “Romani” ethnicity, she ended up registering them by their skin color.\n\n“There are policies catered to Indigenous peoples, Black and Brown people, but not for Romani people. We have our own culture, but we do not show up, which is why I say being Romani is being invisible,” she claims.\n\nRamanush experienced a similar situation when a census taker visited him during the most recent census in Brazil in 2022. “She asked me what my race was, and I answered that it was not on the list. My complexion is white, but I’m a Romani.”\n\nIBGE estimates that Brazil has between 800,000 and a million Romani, but the Roma groups believe the numbers are higher.\n\n“I've already travelled all over Brazil meeting Romani people from all ethnic groups. Without official data, there are no efficient public policies,” Ramanush explains. “Even to count how many Romani there are in each city or town, local governments make the process difficult.”\n\nBesides the lack of recognition, Romani people living in peripheral areas also face a prejudice that runs through generations. They have been accused of theft, robbery, and deception for centuries. It wasn’t rare to have them associated with kidnapping children.\n\nTrying to change this reality and fight prejudice, Romani groups have been mobilized for the approval of a bill making teaching Romani culture and history in schools mandatory — modeling what already happens with Black and Indigenous people in Brazil. The proposal presented by federal deputy Helder Salomão (PT, Workers’ Party), at the Chamber of Deputies as Bill 3547 of 2015, has made little progress.\n\nIn their justification, the text reinforces the idea that for centuries Romani groups have been experiencing prejudice, marginalization, exclusion and persecution. So, the bill aims to “change the image of Romani populations, trying to reduce prejudice and discrimination that these groups are subjected to.”\n\nThe bill also asserts that providing visibility for Romani groups “will provide a more fertile ground to build public policies focusing on the promotion of human rights.”",

    "title": "Cambodian and Thai activists unite to end hostility and promote peace over border disputes",
    "text": "This article was published by Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand. An edited version has been republished by Global Voices under a content-sharing agreement.\n\nBetween July and May 2025, tensions between Thailand and Cambodia over a border dispute devolved into violence that left at least 43 dead on both sides, dozens injured, and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Despite signing a ceasefire agreement on July 28, hostility has remained deeply embedded in both countries, fueled by misinformation. Amidst the turmoil, Cambodians and Thais have come together to launch a cross-border campaign aimed at combating hatred and promoting empathy and lasting peace.\n\nThailand and Cambodia share over 700 kilometres of border, where several undemarcated sections have been long-standing sources of conflict between the two countries, since the Preah Vihear dispute beginning in the 1950s, to this year when clashes broke out on May 28th and led to fatalities on July 24th. On top of that, the countries also share historical and cultural ties, which have complicated the tensions between them, leading to deep-rooted hostility between the two peoples.\n\nHostility skyrocketed after the July 24 armed conflict as the conflict between the two governments trickled down to all facets of society. Cambodian and Thai netizens traded accusations on who initiated the clashes.\n\n“We see all the problems start to unfold, and when hatreds, prejudice, and discrimination on people’s level have gone online, it was even more devastating for us, and that's why we decided to come together on the Cambodian side to rally among ourselves,” said Lim Solinn, a Cambodian social activist and artist. She later reached out to friends in Thailand in different places and then stumbled upon a group of Thai people who are a network of solidarity.\n\nOu Tepphallin, a Cambodian labor rights activist and campaign co-organizer, said she joined the campaign to address the suffering of migrant workers and communities caught in the crossfire of recent tensions, particularly Cambodian workers in Thailand and Thai workers in Cambodia.\n\nThey faced physical violence and racism, and they were living with fear, so their voices were unheard. On top of that, children living along the border have lost opportunities to study due to the closure of border crossings. Family members were separated, such as a child whose mother was in Thailand but whose father was in Phnom Penh, and they have no idea when they can be reunited.\n\nIn addition, according to the Thai authorities, the conflict since July 24th has also caused over 500,000 Cambodian migrant workers in Thailand to return home, since most of them felt unsafe and threatened in Thailand. This has left Thailand with a significant labor shortage as Cambodian migrants typically played an essential role in the country's agricultural industry.\n\nSolinn stated that both Thai and Cambodian campaign organizers want the campaign to go viral in both countries and send messages to leaders saying, “Please don't use violence on Cambodian or Thai migrant workers.”\n\nThe campaigners are also trying to figure out catchy ways for this campaign to go viral and reach regular Thais and Cambodians. The campaign includes writing poems and making songs, which they believe could help calm people and encourage them not to hate simply because of what they heard or saw on the news.\n\n“We’re just starting, even if the war ends tomorrow, the hatred continues, so we need to continue this work and reach out to more communities in Cambodia and in Thailand,” said Solinn.\n\nPhallin added that it's time to heal those who suffered from both sides, and that is what the campaign did by starting to send healing messages to ordinary people.\n\nWhen hatred is louder than empathy\n\nIn Thailand, when the armed conflict erupted and innocent Thai civilians and military personnel were killed, many Thai netizens demanded tit for tat retaliation. In addition, right-wing influencers have threatened Cambodian migrant workers and called on patriots to use violence against them.\n\nOften, those who oppose this and call for a peaceful approach face condemnation online for being too optimistic or unpatriotic.\n\n“All the ordinary Cambodians want nothing but peace and harmony with our neighbours, and a lot of people get caught in between these polarizations, and because of the level of their vulnerability, they cannot get their voices heard at all,” noted Solinn.\n\nOn the Cambodian side, Solinn remarked that while they wanted peace and for this war to stop, most Cambodians also became enraged and emotional when they saw news about civilians being affected, schools being bombed, or news that many people were displaced.\n\nShe disclosed that since she and her friends launched the campaign, she has been harassed by netizens from both countries. For her, it has been difficult to get through to people how the hyper-nationalistic, violent narratives are spreading hate. Solinn said:\n\nThey have been misinformed and disinformed. They believe these sets of stories, and they have these perspectives, and it's hard to change. So, instead of trying to tell them a different version, we’re trying to appeal to their consciousness. We try to appeal to their empathy.\n\nEven though most of the information they received was not real, it was effective as it was coupled with prejudice, stereotyping, and hate speech amplified by social media. “It has added fuel to the fire of ultra nationalist perspectives. It just made it really hard for people to try to bridge across for people who are like us,” said Solinn.\n\nShe insisted that engaging with the same outrage and accusing each other of doing what each side thinks is wrong will not improve the situation, particularly for disputes that have been going on for hundreds of years, based on selective history from both sides.\n\nSolinn emphasized that it was time to put people’s lives first. Children should be able to return to school instead of living in refugee camps, families should be able to earn their livelihoods again, and both countries need to recognize the damage the conflict has inflicted on their economies.\n\nA call for peace: rebuilding trust and fostering empathy\n\n“We would like to urge the leaders to sit down and find a peaceful resolution and put the people first,” said Phallin. She also urged the leaders to negotiate and rebuild trust, insisting that peace can be achieved only by negotiation, not war.\n\nIn the meantime, Solinn urged the leaders to be compassionate and gentle and to reach a peaceful resolution, adding that a tremendous amount of strength is required. The campaign organizer also called on leaders on both sides to stop this war and allow everything to return to normal for the sake of the innocent people from both countries.\n\nShe suggested that Thailand and Cambodia stop promoting biases and stereotypes based on selective interpretations of history, particularly for the younger generations.\n\nSolinn also believes that when this war ends, Thais and Cambodians will come together to create mixed communities where people from both sides could share safe spaces and raise awareness of peace and harmony.\n\n“Educating in school or through the media wouldn't be enough. We need all the spaces, all the communities, we need a whole society to heal and to promote racial tolerance, peace, solidarity, and harmony,” said Phallin.\n\nIn terms of media, Solinn said media, particularly mainstream media, in both countries should not amplify hateful rhetoric, which has already been dominant on social media, but rather people’s stories, which would help promote reconciliation and peace, suggesting that selective parts of the history on both sides shouldn’t be allowed to frame the whole narrative about Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nShe noted that we did not know everything, but only heard different sides of the story. Each side believed the other started the war first or believed that the other side encroached upon their land.\n\n“Trust is so fragile. It's so easy to break, and it's broken already. It's very hard to rebuild, but we must try. We do not have a choice,” noted Solinn.",

    "title": "The judiciary’s dilemma: Protecting Nigeria’s whistleblowers without legislation",
    "text": "Nigeria’s whistleblower policy, introduced on December 21, 2016, was designed as a quick fix to expose systemic corruption. It promised whistleblowers between 2.5 and 5 percent of recovered looted public funds. However, while the policy incentivizes disclosures, it does not guarantee protection.\n\nInstead, whistleblowers often face surveillance, dismissal, or even death threats. Multiple attempts to pass a whistleblower protection bill over the years have stalled in Nigeria’s National Assembly, leaving whistleblowers legally vulnerable.\n\nNigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework\n\nOn September 18, 2025, Federal High Court judges and civil society advocates debated on Nigeria’s fragile whistleblowing framework at a national interactive forum convened by the African Centre for Media & Information Literacy (AFRICMIL) for federal high court judges, in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city.\n\nHarry Ogwuche, the Director of Economic and Social Rights at Nigeria’s National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), shared during the debate:\n\nProtecting whistleblowers is not an abstract anti-corruption strategy; it is a direct, proactive investment in the enjoyment of fundamental human rights as enshrined in Chapter IV of our Constitution and various international covenants Nigeria is party to.\n\nThe role of judges in protecting whistleblowers\n\nWhile seeking the support of judges in the advocacy for a whistleblower protection law in Nigeria, Chido Onumah, Coordinator of AFRICMIL, said:\n\nJudges are key actors in any judicial system. Therefore, the forum aims to provide a platform for interaction with judges on whistleblowing, its legal framework, and the critical role they play in ensuring justice for whistleblowers and handling corruption cases effectively.\n\nAt the forum, persecuted whistleblower Yisa Usman shared how he was pressured, intimidated, and sidelined from his profession after blowing the whistle on his company. Usman is a chartered accountant who worked in the finance and accounts department, but after exposing corruption, he was redeployed to the ICT department, transferred to different states, and subsequently fired. He said:\n\nBecause I decided to speak up, I am jobless. I was ostracized and frustrated to accept the norm. To remain silent is to be complicit. To achieve results as a whistleblower, it is important to be familiar with the laws because if you know the laws that guide and protect you, you will be able to challenge them. Despite several attempts to detain me, I am walking free because of the judiciary.\n\nExisting and pending laws to protect whistleblowers\n\nNigeria’s Constitution and several statutes already contain protections that could be extended to whistleblowers. These include: Section 39 of the 1999 Constitution, which guarantees freedom of expression. Section 6(4)(c) of the National Human Rights Commission Act prohibits harassment of individuals who cooperate with the Commission. Anti-corruption laws like the EFCC Act and ICPC Act provide limited safeguards. The Freedom of Information Act protects disclosures made in good faith.\n\nIn practice, these fragmented provisions are inconsistently applied, and without a unified protection law, whistleblowers continue to face retaliation.\n\nNigeria’s situation contrasts sharply with that of its regional neighbors. Ghana’s Whistleblower Act (Act 720) and South Africa’s Protected Disclosures Act provide dedicated mechanisms.\n\nVladimir Radomirović, a Serbian journalist and co-founder of Pištaljka, an organization based in Belgrade that provides free legal aid and protection to whistleblowers, shared his experiences of building alliances with the judiciary to strengthen whistleblower protection in Serbia. He said:\n\nThe judges have a very influential role in protecting whistleblowers in Serbia, and we try to work with judges and allow them to hear from whistleblowers about how they are retaliated against for protecting the public interest.\n\nAFRICMIL and its partners urged the Nigerian legislature to urgently enact the whistleblower protection law, one that guarantees anonymity, provides penalties against retaliation, and establishes an independent body to oversee cases.\n\nWhistleblowers and civil society organizations appealed to judges to embrace a proactive role in safeguarding whistleblowers. They called for progressive adjudication that interprets existing laws in the spirit of transparency and protection for defenders; expedited hearings to ensure justice is not delayed and therefore denied; the awarding of exemplary damages against retaliators to serve as a deterrent; and above all, the protection of anonymity in court procedures. These recommendations, they argued, are vital if the judiciary is to strengthen trust, uphold justice, and ensure that whistleblowing truly serves as a tool for accountability in Nigeria.",

    "title": "Nepal’s Khoj Samachar challenges corruption and empowers youth through digital media",
    "text": "There are nearly 4,900 registered print media outlets in Nepal. Around eighteen news outlets operate exclusively online through digital platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. By law, online media must register with Nepal’s Department of Information and Broadcasting; however, not all outlets currently comply with this requirement.\n\nStanding out among these registered outlets is Khoj Samachar, an independent digital media platform that raises awareness among young people, challenges corruption, and amplifies underrepresented voices in Nepal. Its founder, Roshan Shrestha, is an investigative journalist from Nepal. His approach relies on digital platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and a dedicated app to draw public attention to marginalized stories and pressure authorities to take action. The platform publishes content in Nepali, in both text and video formats.\n\nAbdulrosheed Fadipe of Global Voices interviewed Roshan via WhatsApp to discuss his journey as an investigative journalist and how he uses digital platforms to promote social change, strengthen good governance, and encourage citizen engagement in Nepal.\n\nGlobal Voices (GV): What inspired you to start Khoj Samachar, and what challenges did you face in building it from scratch?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): I started my journalism journey during my school years at Shree Bachchhala Devi Higher Secondary School, Nagpuje, Sindhupalchok District, in Bagmati Province of Nepal. When I was in class 8, a man who was the presenter at Avenues Television came to my school to teach students about journalism. That training programme planted the seed of journalism in my mind.\n\nMy interest in journalism grew after a devastating earthquake occurred in Nepal in 2015. Although the epicenter of the earthquake was located in Gorkha district, many houses in my village, which is located near the Bhotekoshi River, were destroyed. Many people lost their lives. The Tataponi border crossing with China was also closed. I had just completed class 11 then. I was using a simple Android phone because I was from a low-middle-class family that depended on agriculture for a living. With that phone, I started filming and uploading videos of the earthquake's destruction of villages on a YouTube channel. This was how my journalism career began.\n\nIn 2021, I officially launched Khoj Samachar. I did not receive any financial support when I started nor did I have a big team. Now we have a team of four individuals broadcasting news in both English and Nepali.\n\nGV: How do you maintain editorial independence and ensure your outlet's content remains unbiased and free from external influences?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): We do not take money, favors, or support from any political party, business group, or outside donor. From day one, Khoj Samachar has survived only through the income we earn from Facebook and YouTube ads. With those limited earnings, we pay our team and run the entire platform. This is not always easy, but it gives us full freedom. Nobody can tell us what to say or what to hide. We can question leaders, expose corruption, and speak for the people without fear of losing sponsors or upsetting funders. Our only loyalty is to our readers and viewers. For us, independence is more valuable than comfort. Even if the road is difficult, we choose truth over compromise — that is why our content remains unbiased and trusted.\n\nGV: How do you prioritize stories that amplify underrepresented media voices, and what impact do you hope these stories have on your audience?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): At Khoj Samachar, we always give priority to the voices that big media often ignores — farmers, workers, rural youth, and ordinary citizens who face injustice. Many times, people from villages directly contact us to share their pain, because they feel unheard elsewhere.\n\nWe have highlighted stories like that of a person struggling to get a bridge built in his village, a road left unfinished for 10 years, or a family trapped in hardship without support. By showing these issues through videos, we try to bring public attention and pressure the authorities to act.\n\nOur hope is that by giving a platform to these underrepresented voices, young people will feel more connected, more aware, and inspired to raise their own voices. We want our audience to see that journalism is not only about leaders and cities, but also about the real struggles of common people — and that truth can bring real change.\n\nGV: What strategies do you use to reach audiences beyond capital cities, and how do you measure the impact of your reporting in these areas?\n\nRoshan Shrestha (RS): From the beginning, our focus was not only on Kathmandu but also on rural and remote areas. We create stories that reflect the real problems of villages — like missing bridges in Humla, neglected roads in Dailekh, or migrant workers’ struggles. Many of these issues are sent to us directly by local people through phone calls, Facebook messages, or our app. By turning their voices into reports and videos, we make sure their problems are heard nationally.\n\nTo measure impact, we look at the response from citizens and authorities. For example, in Saudi Arabia, when stranded workers contacted us, our coverage led to parliamentary debates and direct government action. Similarly, when we cover local problems, we monitor community feedback in comments, shares, and messages, and also check if the government or local representatives respond. For us, the real impact is when ordinary people feel their voices are finally heard and some positive change begins.\n\nGV: What are some of the biggest challenges you've faced as an independent journalist, and how have you overcome them?\n\nRS: There have been many difficult moments in my journey, but the most painful ones came when some people, who are unable to accept the truth, started abusing my family and even threatened physical attacks in public. As a journalist, I can tolerate criticism and risk, but when my family is dragged into controversy for my work, it is truly unbearable.\n\nSpeaking the truth, especially against corruption and powerful figures, always brings political pressure. Many tried to silence us or scare us into stopping, but journalism loses its meaning if we compromise with fear. What keeps me going is the trust and support of the public and the inner courage to always speak the truth. The emotional burden is heavy, but I continue because ordinary people rely on us to be their voice, and that responsibility gives me the strength to move forward.\n\nGV: How do you envision the future of Khoj Samachar, and what steps are you taking to ensure its sustainability and continued impact?\n\nRS: My main goal is to build Khoj Samachar as a platform based only on truth and facts, not dependent on external funding or political power. The message I want to pass to youth is that they can succeed in journalism by standing for the truth, even if they are alone. I am working to add more features to the Roshan Shrestha App so that it will be useful for the public. This step will help us sustain our work, expand our impact, and keep serving society with independent journalism.\n\nGV: Why did you name the Roshan Shrestha App after yourself?\n\nRS: By putting my own name on the app, I wanted to assure users that this platform is genuine, transparent, and trustworthy. It is not for self-promotion but rather a matter of responsibility: if my name is attached, people know they can rely on it.",

When you fill out the survey, you will also be entered for one of eight chances to win $250! (Everyone who has already filled out the survey will be automatically entered into the draw).\n\nYour voice is critical in shaping the future of ʔaq̓am Own Source Revenue. There is an opportunity to make sure OSR is used strategically now and into the future, as these funds may increase, decrease, or even disappear over time.\n\nThe OSR survey is helping the OSR Committee gauge themes, priorities, and ideas with your direct input. Your participation is supporting policy development, research, and goals.\n\nLink to the survey, open until September 30, 2025:\n\nhttps://forms.office.com/r/uXfzUpbB8A\n\nPrinted versions of the survey are available at the front desk of the Band office.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nAfter the survey closes, the OSR Committee and Engagement Coordinator will be in touch to begin booking one-on-one and group sessions. The sessions will involve a deeper discussion and will be held in family/friend/focus groups or individually, if preferred. All Band members 15 and over will have the opportunity to participate once and will be asked the exact same questions.\n\nThe OSR Committee will then follow up with a ‘what we heard’ report and a draft of the policy for community input and feedback.\n\nWhat is OSR?\n\nʔaq̓am OSR are all revenues the Band makes or receives that are not tied to programs or operational funding. OSR originates from various sources, with some directly tied to Title and Rights.\n\nWhy do we need a policy?\n\nThe ʔaq̓am OSR policy is intended to be the voice of the people and a document that outlines how OSR should support community, guided by ka kniⱡwi·tiyaⱡa. ʔaq̓am OSR has the potential to support ʔaq̓amnik̓ for generations to come. That’s why our decisions as a community now will have impacts in the present and into the future.\n\nThe amounts of OSR can increase, decrease, or even disappear over time, but there are many ways it can provide short and long-term benefits if we plan ahead.\n\nWhy not go directly to a vote?\n\nMaking sure our future OSR policy is equitable and transparent is important. The OSR Committee is committed to providing opportunities for everybody to be heard.\n\nMultiple engagements might feel like a lot when other communities have gone straight to vote, but an in-depth process will support a policy that reflects the in-depth voice of our community.\n\nThere are many ways that OSR can be used. A balanced policy will ensure OSR is used in ways that benefit the community as a whole and our members individually, now and for the long-term.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding OSR or the policy development process, please reach out to the OSR Engagement Coordinator.\n\nOSR Engagement Coordinator: Bailey Repp\n\nbrepp@aqam.net\n\n236-361-0110\n\nThe ʔaq̓am OSR Committee",

    "title": "Energy security work continues in three First Nation communities",
    "text": "By Phil Climie, Project Manager, Community Energy\n\nContinuing forward\n\nSince the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Community Energy team’s approach has shifted to supporting projects from afar. As we find ourselves in fall 2020, this project work forges on, largely due to community members stepping into larger roles. While this dynamic asks more of our partners, it supports local development into each project, allowing for a greater focus on each community’s approach.\n\nOne of the many changes the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to us all is the increased time we spend at home. With many people out of work, others working from home, and fewer safe public spaces available, the home has become even more central to our lives. For those who do not have access to safe, affordable, comfortable homes, previously difficult situations can be exacerbated. We know that the people in British Columba who struggle with energy poverty are in these tough situations right now, feeling even more pressure to maintain adequate heating and other basic energy needs for their homes. COVID-19 has highlighted growing disparities in home energy security in BC, furthering the case for expediting justice-based solutions that provide safe, comfortable, and affordable home energy for those who are most impacted.\n\nBelow are three examples of important energy security work that continues to take place in our partner communities this year.\n\nQuatsino First Nation\n\nNorthern Vancouver Island\n\nIn 2019, Quatsino First Nation and Barkley Project Group completed a Community Energy Plan that identified households in their community were spending nearly triple the average BC Hydro customer on electricity. Home energy models and energy audits suggest that each home could save well over $1,000 a year in energy costs by installing ductless air-source heat pumps. Heat pumps significantly decrease the energy demands of the home as they are more than three times more energy efficient than baseboard electric heaters. In addition to reducing consumption, heat pumps circulate warm air more effectively than radiant heaters by cycling air over a heat exchanger and blowing it throughout the homes’ primary living spaces.\n\nIn August 2020, 23 ductless air-source heat pumps were installed in 15 elders’ homes: eight homes received two systems, and seven homes received a single system. The heating contractor — Precise Heating — sized and placed the units according to each homes’ heating needs and the preferences of the occupants. For this phase of installations, elders were given priority by Quatsino Chief and Council to ensure they are best equipped to handle the cold, winter months. In the warmer months, the ‘heat’ pumps have a cooling mode that enables them to function as high efficiency air conditioners, an important benefit expressed by Quatsino leadership due to the hot summer temperatures of their inland location.\n\nHaíłzaqv Nation\n\nBella Bella, Central Coast\n\nThe Heiltsuk Nation continues their ongoing work of replacing oil furnaces with air-source heat pumps in Bella Bella homes. At present, a pilot project for central air-source heat pumps has led to the installation of 60 systems to date. Since central air-source heat pumps utilize ducting from the previous oil furnace systems, they provide opportunities for uniform heating throughout the home.\n\nAs applications for heat pumps come in from community members, it is with little surprise, yet great dismay, to learn of the current heating experiences of many members. Nearly half of all applications received have been classified as ‘critical’ in nature, meaning they have no functioning heating system, or their systems are aging out or unreliable. A remaining majority of applicants fall within the ‘nearing critical’ classification. One other criterion for selection is the cost for some members on fixed incomes, such as Elders or those on disability. The Nation believes that cleaner more affordable heat for its members is a worthy investment and continues to seek funding mechanisms to continue this initiative.\n\nTo ensure that local skills and labour are leveraged throughout the project, the installation contractor for the project — Coastal Heat Pumps — has been training and working with Heiltsuk members on the decommissioning of oil systems, preparation of homes, cleaning of ducting, and installations of heat pumps, since 2018. Pamela Wilson, a member of Heiltsuk Nation and principal at Tagila Consulting, has taken on primary management of the project, with the support of a Heiltsuk Heat Pump working group.\n\n“We all know that one of the greatest challenges on reserve is housing. We have all heard the horrific stories of substandard building materials that have led to dilapidated homes on reserve, we are no exception. The lack of heat goes hand in hand with mould in our homes. One of the elders who was a recent recipient shared that she forgot what it felt like to have a house that was warm in every room, and said that she had to ask her daughter to take her portable heater out of her bedroom as it was a habit for her to turn it on at night before bed. It’s these stories that make this work so rewarding and I am honoured to be a part of it.\n\nThe goal by the end of March 2021 is to have installed 100 heat pumps. Funding the project is like a project in itself. This round of funding that we are currently working with comes from six separate sources. The logistics and reporting requirements for this type of funding structure requires detail and attention and that is where Ecotrust Canada provides expertise in proposal writing as well as management of the overall project, including the collection and record of data management, which will be crucial to reflecting the need in community and justifying future funding applications.”\n\n— Pamela Wilson, Tagila Consulting\n\n‘ N am g is First Nation\n\nCormorant Island\n\nIn 2019, we visited Cormorant Island to meet with ‘ N am g is First Nation, Whe-la-la-u Area Council, and the Village of Alert Bay. From our discussions, we learned about the island’s long-standing struggles with aging heating systems, unmaintained homes, and consequently high energy costs.\n\nRepresentatives from ‘ N am g is First Nation noted that numerous homes had been disconnected from their electricity supply in recent history due to payments in arrears. BC Hydro has a Customer Crisis Fund in place to provide support in these situations, however our research was corroborated by the experiences of ‘ N am g is First Nation staff who have stopped recommending and supporting members’ applications to the program due to low success rates. While BC Hydro did cease all disconnections for three months this summer due to the COVID-19 crisis, as we enter the winter non-payment outages are once again a possibility for homes in economic distress. Our Energy team will continue to advocate for better solutions for those struggling to maintain their homes’ energy supply.\n\nSince meeting last year, Ecotrust Canada and ‘ N am g is First Nation have partnered to complete a Housing Energy Assessment with the purpose of reviewing the current state of housing and energy in the community. With Vancity support, this project will include a survey to gather community feedback, a multi-year analysis of BC Hydro bills, and the construction of home energy models in RETScreen Expert. Together, these elements will help determine the costs and benefits of different project opportunities that improve energy security.\n\nUnderstanding the challenge\n\nAs the days shorten and temperatures drop, the Community Energy team is thinking about the hundreds of thousands of people who are living in energy poverty. Energy poverty is a pervasive issue throughout BC that has significant effects on health and well-being. During our work in late 2019 with the Regional District of Mount Waddington, we identified that one in three residents face challenges paying their home energy bills, and one in five residents have been forced to forgo other basic needs such as food, clothing, and transportation to meet payments — and this was before the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWith governments speaking more about energy efficiency and retrofit economies, our team is encouraged by the increased attention toward addressing factors that contribute to energy poverty. We will continue to advocate for culturally appropriate home energy solutions that reduce energy costs, improve comfort, and stimulate local economies while reducing demands on natural resources and harmful effects on the planet. British Columbia is ready for an increased commitment to alleviating energy poverty altogether, and the province’s rural, remote, and Indigenous communities are prepared to participate.",

    "text": "Premier John Horgan announced Wednesday measures brought in by BC Hydro to address the economic impacts of COVID-19 — including a universal one per cent reduction in rates for all customers.\n\nResidential customers who have lost jobs or had wages reduced as a result of COVID-19 will receive a credit worth three times their average monthly bill over the past year. It will not have to be repaid.\n\nSmall businesses forced to close as a result of COVID-19 will have their April to June 2020 bills forgiven.\n\nBC Hydro will also give the option of a three-month deferment to large businesses.\n\nMajor industry partners, including pulp mills and mines, will be able to defer 50 per cent of their bill for three months.\n\nWatch Premier John Horgan address economic anxieties:\n\nPremier Horgan: ‘Anxiety is high’ Duration 1:02 B.C. Premier John Horgan says it’s going to take ‘extraordinary resilience from British Columbians to get through’ the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSmall businesses will be able to apply starting the week of April 14. Customers have until June 30 to apply.\n\n\"These initiatives are in place for today, not for forever and we will be able to guide British Columbians as we get closer to bending that curve,\" said Horgan.\n\n\"We will do everything we can to support them.\"\n\n$477 reduction for average out-of-work residential customer\n\nMinister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources Bruce Ralston said the rate reduction is the first rate decrease \"in decades,\" and is not a result of COVID-19.\n\nA written statement from the province said the average residential customer's bill is $159 per month, and the average credit provided will be $477. Some customers may also be eligible for BC Hydro's existing Customer Crisis Fund, which provides access to grants of up to $600 to pay their bills.\n\nThe average bill savings for small businesses who qualify will be $121 per month, so the average total bill savings would be $363.\n\nBC Hydro has also halted all service disconnections for non-payment during COVID-19 and cancelled all non-emergency planned power outages affecting its customers.\n\nRalston said the cost of the programs targeted toward residential customers and small business will cost between $80 and 90 million.\n\nHorgan said the BC Utilities Commission is in discussions with FortisBC — a private utility company that provides natural gas and electricity to B.C. residents — about what reductions they will be offering to customers, and that its program will likely mirror what is being done by BC Hydro.\n\nIf you have a COVID-19-related story we should pursue that affects British Columbians, please email us at impact@cbc.ca.",

    "title": "How a justice-based approach to home retrofits can help end energy poverty",
    "text": "By Dylan Heerema, Senior Analyst and Researcher\n\nCanadians spend as much as 90% of their lives indoors, so it’s no surprise that draughty, inefficient housing contributes to a whole host of problems, such as mould and moisture, and corresponding health issues including asthma, cardiovascular disease, and increased vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19. Nowhere are the impacts of energy-inefficient housing more pronounced than in low- and middle-income households, where limited funds for upgrades and higher energy bills create a vicious circle that only serves to perpetuate energy poverty — which now afflicts over 2.8 million Canadian households.\n\nWhat are the equity and justice implications of energy access and use in the home? At Ecotrust Canada, our Community Energy team has been exploring this question through the lens of energy poverty, and the drivers of lack of access to affordable energy services. This year, we produced research reports on the impact of energy poverty on rural, remote, and Indigenous communities in BC, as well as on the need for sustained, meaningful bill protections for the most energy-vulnerable households.\n\nBill protections, designed to offset energy costs for vulnerable customers, are only one part of the solution. A complete policy approach to ending energy poverty must also include strategies for raising wages and creating more secure employment — now more than ever as we rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also a third part of the equation, which relates to the way we use energy in our homes and buildings. This work is often simply labelled ‘energy efficiency’, yet it’s important to remember that there is much more than efficiency at stake when we consider the related impacts to the comfort and safety of our homes.\n\nUpcoming energy efficiency research\n\nThis winter, we will be teaming up with the Canadian Urban Sustainability Practitioners (CUSP) Network and UBC’s Sustainability Scholars Program to conduct the next phase of our research into energy poverty. We are excited to welcome Laura MacTaggart, on board from UBC as a student researcher, as she investigates how a new generation of energy efficiency and retrofit programming could help bring healthier homes and reduced energy bills to those that need them most.\n\nHome energy retrofits = job creation\n\nThe benefits of retrofitting homes, to make them energy efficient and low-carbon, is a critical pathway to reducing carbon emissions, and an effective job creator and boost for economic activity. For example, every $1M invested in programs that support home energy retrofits creates between 16-30 jobs, a far greater number than most other sectors including resource extraction. This is one reason why Canada’s Task Force for a Resilient Recovery, among other groups, are recommending tens of billions of dollars in new funding for retrofits as part of an economic recovery strategy. Yet, we rarely consider who stands to benefit from such investments, and who is at risk of being left behind.\n\nEnergy programs are missing the mark\n\nIn British Columbia, for example, since 2008 the Energy Conservation Assistance Program has offered free energy efficiency upgrades for income-qualifying households. Unfortunately, this program has not achieved widespread adoption or significant bill savings. Only around 5% of the 350,000 households eligible for ECAP have participated in the program to date. Uncovering the reasons for this low uptake will be a major part of this new research, but limited awareness and low cost savings are among the contributing factors. Of households that do participate in ECAP, the average bill savings has amounted to less than $100 per year. These savings are largely insignificant when compared to the steady rise in energy costs in BC, particularly electricity prices, which have increased by almost 50% in the last decade. Such programs, while undoubtedly delivering positive outcomes for some participants, cannot deliver impacts at the scale needed to eliminate energy poverty in their current form.\n\nMore recently, programs designed to help cover the costs of highly efficient appliances, like air source heat pumps, have been introduced by some provinces. In BC, this includes the Indigenous Community Heat Pump Incentive, and rebates offered through Better Homes BC. Unfortunately, many rebates are only available to those who are switching from natural gas or oil to an electric heat pump, leaving many low-income households that rely on inefficient electric baseboard heaters ineligible. Without rebates to help cover the initial cost, heating system retrofits — and the savings that come with them — remain out of reach for many households.\n\nThe current focus among policymakers is on electrification of buildings, which is a necessary step toward addressing climate change, but on its own will not be enough to lift all Canadians out of energy poverty.\n\nThe scale of current low-income energy programs is not adequate. BC Hydro, for example, currently spends between $6-8M per year on its low-income efficiency programs. Yet, providing meaningful upgrades to all eligible low-income customers in BC would likely require billions of dollars of public investment over the coming decades, as well as innovative new options (like the PACE model) for financing retrofit projects. Despite the enormity of this challenge, the current pandemic is teaching us that letting the most vulnerable live in unhealthy and unaffordable conditions could have a more profound negative impact on our health care system, human lives, and the very fabric of our society.\n\nA social justice-based program is needed\n\nRethinking home energy retrofit programs in BC and making progress on eliminating energy poverty is not simply a matter of increasing funding for existing programs. Systemic issues, like social and racial inequity, power dynamics, and a lack of accountability, must be addressed. Poorly-designed programs can also introduce other barriers to participation, including lack of awareness, administrative confusion, and mistrust of service providers. A holistic, justice-based program approach is needed: one that ensures that energy access is affordable and safe for everyone. Our latest research will look at new models for program design and delivery, incorporating lessons and examples from the most successful programs across North America. We look forward to sharing this work with you as it unfolds.",

    "text": "Saskatchewan farmers say drought conditions in some parts of the province are the worst they have seen in decades and higher operating costs these days will make it harder to bounce back.\n\nFields in some southern parts of the province are so parched that seeds have failed to germinate, leaving some farmers with little or no hay for feed.\n\nSome areas have seen less than 100 millimetres of moisture since April, according to the latest crop report.\n\nAlan Dumontel is a semi-retired farmer whose son and daughter-in-law manage cattle in one of the worst-affected areas near Frontier, Sask., about 400 kilometres southwest of Regina.\n\nNot the 1st drought\n\nHe remembers bouts of dry conditions in the 1960s, '70s and '80s but said farmers had gotten used to higher-than-average rainfall in the past 15 to 20 years.\n\nDumontel said it was a shock to go back to drier conditions.\n\n\"It's new to the young people but it's not new to us,\" said Dumontel.\n\n\"We've seen this before many times, it's just kind of a bit uncommon to have 27 inches of rain last year and back up with a drought here.\"\n\nA map that illustrates the cumulative rainfall, or lack thereof, from April 1 to July 10 in Saskatchewan. (Government of Saskatchewan )\n\nToo wet, then too dry\n\nDumontel said wet, muddy conditions at the start of the season left his family with a window of only a week to seed their fields.\n\nSince then, he said it has been so dry that the seeds in his field never got enough moisture to germinate.\n\nAlthough he has been through drought before, he expected that higher operating costs would make it tougher for farmers in the worst-hit areas to recover.\n\n\"The problem is now you need a lot more money to operate these operations and it's not the same as it was in the dry years before,\" said Dumontel.\n\n\"You know, we always had expenses but they are not like they are now.\"\n\nCattle farmers feeling the pinch\n\nHe said operating expenses had risen with higher incomes over the years but this year's drought conditions would make it tougher for some to keep up with those costs.\n\nDumontel predicted cattle farmers would be worst affected because they have mouths to feed at a time when hay will be more scarce and more expensive.\n\nPioneer Co-op agronomist Eric Oliver said cattle ranchers were already feeling the pinch, with a combination of hay expenses and water issues.\n\nDry conditions bring the risk of toxic blue-green algae developing in dugouts, and salinity problems that can be fatal to livestock if left unchecked.\n\nEarlier this month, 200 animals in a grazing pasture near Shamrock, Sask., died from a combination of dehydration, poor water quality and heat.\n\nWater issues\n\nOliver said addressing serious water-quality problems could be costly.\n\n\"They're going to have to either move cattle to a different location where there is water or haul water to them,\" he said.\n\nOliver also noted the stark contrast between current conditions and the wet conditions earlier this year that forced some farmers to seed later than usual, only to find their crops parched within a matter of months.\n\n\"For those crops that are very severely affected, it's game over for this year. It's next-year country, so they're just trying to salvage what they can,\" he said.\n\nCanola a fragile crop\n\nFor those farmers whose crops are still standing, the yield might still be disappointing.\n\nMichel Lepage grows canola, wheat and barley on about 800 acres near St-Denis, Sask.\n\nHe said canola is a more fragile crop that needs more moisture to produce properly.\n\n\"The wind, the heat will limit the time that the crop has to flower,\" said Lepage.\n\n\"And if it doesn't flower long enough then the pods that the flowers produce will be less numerous and won't be as big, so they won't produce as much.\"",

(Government of Saskatchewan )\n\nToo wet, then too dry\n\nDumontel said wet, muddy conditions at the start of the season left his family with a window of only a week to seed their fields.\n\nSince then, he said it has been so dry that the seeds in his field never got enough moisture to germinate.\n\nAlthough he has been through drought before, he expected that higher operating costs would make it tougher for farmers in the worst-hit areas to recover.\n\n\"The problem is now you need a lot more money to operate these operations and it's not the same as it was in the dry years before,\" said Dumontel.\n\n\"You know, we always had expenses but they are not like they are now.\"\n\nCattle farmers feeling the pinch\n\nHe said operating expenses had risen with higher incomes over the years but this year's drought conditions would make it tougher for some to keep up with those costs.\n\nDumontel predicted cattle farmers would be worst affected because they have mouths to feed at a time when hay will be more scarce and more expensive.\n\nPioneer Co-op agronomist Eric Oliver said cattle ranchers were already feeling the pinch, with a combination of hay expenses and water issues.\n\nDry conditions bring the risk of toxic blue-green algae developing in dugouts, and salinity problems that can be fatal to livestock if left unchecked.\n\nEarlier this month, 200 animals in a grazing pasture near Shamrock, Sask., died from a combination of dehydration, poor water quality and heat.\n\nWater issues\n\nOliver said addressing serious water-quality problems could be costly.\n\n\"They're going to have to either move cattle to a different location where there is water or haul water to them,\" he said.\n\nOliver also noted the stark contrast between current conditions and the wet conditions earlier this year that forced some farmers to seed later than usual, only to find their crops parched within a matter of months.\n\n\"For those crops that are very severely affected, it's game over for this year. It's next-year country, so they're just trying to salvage what they can,\" he said.\n\nCanola a fragile crop\n\nFor those farmers whose crops are still standing, the yield might still be disappointing.\n\nMichel Lepage grows canola, wheat and barley on about 800 acres near St-Denis, Sask.\n\nHe said canola is a more fragile crop that needs more moisture to produce properly.\n\n\"The wind, the heat will limit the time that the crop has to flower,\" said Lepage.\n\n\"And if it doesn't flower long enough then the pods that the flowers produce will be less numerous and won't be as big, so they won't produce as much.\"",

    "text": "Saskatchewan farmers say drought conditions in some parts of the province are the worst they have seen in decades and higher operating costs these days will make it harder to bounce back.\n\nFields in some southern parts of the province are so parched that seeds have failed to germinate, leaving some farmers with little or no hay for feed.\n\nSome areas have seen less than 100 millimetres of moisture since April, according to the latest crop report.\n\nAlan Dumontel is a semi-retired farmer whose son and daughter-in-law manage cattle in one of the worst-affected areas near Frontier, Sask., about 400 kilometres southwest of Regina.\n\nNot the 1st drought\n\nHe remembers bouts of dry conditions in the 1960s, '70s and '80s but said farmers had gotten used to higher-than-average rainfall in the past 15 to 20 years.\n\nDumontel said it was a shock to go back to drier conditions.\n\n\"It's new to the young people but it's not new to us,\" said Dumontel.\n\n\"We've seen this before many times, it's just kind of a bit uncommon to have 27 inches of rain last year and back up with a drought here.\"\n\nA map that illustrates the cumulative rainfall, or lack thereof, from April 1 to July 10 in Saskatchewan. (Government of Saskatchewan )\n\nToo wet, then too dry\n\nDumontel said wet, muddy conditions at the start of the season left his family with a window of only a week to seed their fields.\n\nSince then, he said it has been so dry that the seeds in his field never got enough moisture to germinate.\n\nAlthough he has been through drought before, he expected that higher operating costs would make it tougher for farmers in the worst-hit areas to recover.\n\n\"The problem is now you need a lot more money to operate these operations and it's not the same as it was in the dry years before,\" said Dumontel.\n\n\"You know, we always had expenses but they are not like they are now.\"\n\nCattle farmers feeling the pinch\n\nHe said operating expenses had risen with higher incomes over the years but this year's drought conditions would make it tougher for some to keep up with those costs.\n\nDumontel predicted cattle farmers would be worst affected because they have mouths to feed at a time when hay will be more scarce and more expensive.\n\nPioneer Co-op agronomist Eric Oliver said cattle ranchers were already feeling the pinch, with a combination of hay expenses and water issues.\n\nDry conditions bring the risk of toxic blue-green algae developing in dugouts, and salinity problems that can be fatal to livestock if left unchecked.\n\nEarlier this month, 200 animals in a grazing pasture near Shamrock, Sask., died from a combination of dehydration, poor water quality and heat.\n\nWater issues\n\nOliver said addressing serious water-quality problems could be costly.\n\n\"They're going to have to either move cattle to a different location where there is water or haul water to them,\" he said.\n\nOliver also noted the stark contrast between current conditions and the wet conditions earlier this year that forced some farmers to seed later than usual, only to find their crops parched within a matter of months.\n\n\"For those crops that are very severely affected, it's game over for this year. It's next-year country, so they're just trying to salvage what they can,\" he said.\n\nCanola a fragile crop\n\nFor those farmers whose crops are still standing, the yield might still be disappointing.\n\nMichel Lepage grows canola, wheat and barley on about 800 acres near St-Denis, Sask.\n\nHe said canola is a more fragile crop that needs more moisture to produce properly.\n\n\"The wind, the heat will limit the time that the crop has to flower,\" said Lepage.\n\n\"And if it doesn't flower long enough then the pods that the flowers produce will be less numerous and won't be as big, so they won't produce as much.\"",

In these disruptive and uncertain times, the proliferation\nand fragmentation of the aid system continues to jeopardise the effectiveness, quality\nand impact of development co-operation. Increased development effectiveness,\nincluding better coordination among diverse partners, reduced transaction costs and\nburdens on partner countries, and strengthened country systems, is needed to\nmaximise the impact of limited resources and better respond to the needs of people and\nthe planet.\nIt is in this context that the UNDP carried out its work on the Global Project on\nManaging Development Co-operation Effectively in 2024, delivering on three\nstrategic components in line with the Global Partnership for Effective Development\nCooperation’s (the ‘Global Partnership’) 2023-2026 Work Programme. The UNDP team\nthat undertook this work is part of the Global Partnership’s OECD-UNDP Joint Support\nTeam (UNDP JST hereafter). This 2024 Annual Status Report provides an overview of\nthe key results achieved by the UNDP JST for the UNDP Global Project over the past\nyear in the areas of monitoring, policy action, and advocacy.\nIt was an important year for the Global Partnership’s partner country-led monitoring\nexercise. After the official launch of the 4th Global Partnership monitoring round in\nJanuary 2023, the UNDP JST supported 34 partner countries in 2024 to undertake the\nmonitoring exercise. This included providing technical assistance, informative sessions,\nand substantive products to support National Coordinators in their implementation of\n“inception” phase of the exercise, as well as supporting countries entering the final\n“reflection, dialogue, and action” phase. Eleven countries finished data collection in\n2024, of which one country completed the final dialogue and action phase with UNDP\nsupport. In addition, a monitoring training for African countries participating in the\ncurrent round of the exercise was held in June in Ethiopia. The UNDP JST provided\nsubstantive and organisational support to the training, as well as co-delivering the\ntraining with OECD colleagues.\nThe UNDP JST also achieved results in policy action in 2024, providing substantive\nsupport to the Global Partnership’s Co-Chairs and Steering Committee members for two\nSteering Committee meetings held in June and November. Preparations for the 4th\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4) in Spain in July 2025,\nkickstarted in 2024. UNDP JST supported Co-Chairs and Steering Committee members\nin raising the profile of development effectiveness on the road to FfD4, including by\ndrafting political messaging and supporting the organization of an Informal Meeting on\nDevelopment Effectiveness and FfD4 on the margins of the Second Preparatory\nCommittee in December 2024 in New York. UNDP JST also supported the first “Action\nDialogue” of the 2023-2026 Monitoring Round which was successfully held in Nepal in\nNovember 2024, generating action-oriented commitments at the policy level, including\n5\nthe adoption of a new Development Finance Information Management System, the\nreview of Nepal’s 2019 Development Co-operation Policy, and the consolidation of\nNepal’s Integrated National Financing Framework (INFF).\nOn advocacy and communications, the UNDP JST conducted a range of activities\nand outputs aligned with the priorities laid out in the 2023-2026 Advocacy & Outreach\nPlan. Highlights from 2024 include the hosting of a side event on the margins of the\nHigh-Level Political Forum (HLPF) in July and supporting a side event at Indonesia’s\nHigh-Level Forum on Multi-Stakeholder Partnership in September. UNDP JST also\ndeveloped new targeted advocacy products, published blogs and stories of progress,\nand disseminated key messages through the Global Partnership’s newsletter and social\nmedia. Finally, preparations were made for the launch of a new website and data\nvisualization platform in 2025.\nAs reflected in this report, throughout 2024, significant progress was made to advance\nthe Global Project on Managing Development Co-operation Effectively. Looking ahead\nto 2025, UNDP JST will continue to advance the Global Project through ongoing support\nto the implementation of the Global Partnership’s 2023-2026 Work Programme. This\nincludes, inter alia, through policy and advocacy work related to FfD4, communications\nwork led by UNDP JST, and close support from UNDP JST to partner countries to carry\nout the Global Partnership’s monitoring exercise,\nThis report is prepared by the Effective Development Co-operation team. The team\nconstitutes the UNDP JST and is part of UNDP’s Bureau for External Relations and\nAdvocacy (BERA).\n6\nABOUT THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP AND THE\nUNDP GLOBAL PROJECT\nAbout the Global Partnership\nThe Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation (‘Global Partnership’) is\nthe primary multi-stakeholder vehicle for driving the effectiveness of all types of\ndevelopment co-operation to deliver sustainable development. By convening partners\naround the four effectiveness principles – country ownership, focus on results, inclusive\npartnerships, and transparency and mutual accountability – the Global Partnership is\nhelping countries catalyze their SDG progress by:\n• Bringing partners together in a principle-led approach, fostering trust, and by\n• Generating data for an evidence-based approach, empowering policy action.\nFigure 1: Graphic explaining the four principles of effective development co-operation\nSource: 'GPEDC At a Glance'\nAt the heart of the work of the Global Partnership is its monitoring exercise. The\nmonitoring is a partner country-led exercise to promote collective accountability on the\neffectiveness of development co-operation. Guided by the four principles, the monitoring\ntracks progress of partner countries, development partners and other actors in\nimplementing their agreed commitments to more effective development co-operation.\nThe monitoring exercise drives behaviour change by focusing on how stakeholders\npartner at the country level for better development results.\nIn 2024, the work of the Global Partnership continued to be guided by the Work\nProgramme for 2023-2026. The overall vision of the Work Programme is to strengthen\nthe effectiveness of development co-operation to spur progress towards the Sustainable\n7\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). The UNDP JST delivers on its core functions through the\nGlobal Project on Managing Development Co-operation Effectively (‘Global Project’) in\nline with the three core outputs of the Work Programme, which are to:\n1. Generate Evidence: through the New Monitoring Exercise\nThe Global Partnership monitoring framework is refined, strengthened, and\nimplemented to support global accountability and mutual learning on effective\ndevelopment co-operation.\n2. Drive Informed Policy Dialogue & Action: through Country Dialogues,\nStrategic Partnerships and the Achievement of the SDGs\nAn increased number of countries strengthen, or are taking action to strengthen,\npolicy and institutional arrangements that support integrated approaches to\nplanning; more efficient management of diverse development co-operation flows;\nand enhanced coordination and stronger multi-stakeholder partnerships.\n3. Foster Political Awareness, Behaviour Change and Uptake: Targeted\nAdvocacy and Outreach\nA strengthened mutual learning and knowledge exchange platform, facilitating\nthe sharing of country-level evidence, and learning from different modalities of\ndevelopment co-operation.\nAbout the UNDP Global Project\nAs part of the OECD-UNDP Joint Support Team (JST), UNDP JST works to strengthen\neffective development co-operation by supporting the work of the Global Partnership.\nWithin the JST, UNDP brings to the Global Partnership its substantive and operational\nfootprint, network, and infrastructure at global, regional, and country levels as well as\ncollaboration across the UN development system. Functions supported by UNDP as\npart of the JST center around policy work related to effective development co-operation,\nsupport to country-level implementation, particularly to anchor the Global Partnership\nmonitoring in country-led efforts to spur implementation of the 2030 Agenda, as well as\nknowledge sharing, communications and advocacy on development effectiveness.\nMoreover, UNDP cultivates a robust effectiveness community through management of\nstrategic communication and knowledge sharing solutions in coordination with the UN\ndevelopment system.\nSpecifically, the following tasks are carried out by UNDP JST:\n• Co-Chairs: UNDP, together with OECD, provides strategic advisory support and\nguidance for Co-Chairs to take decisions and forge consensus.\n• Steering Committee and Work Programme: UNDP, together with OECD,\nprovides strategic advisory support to facilitate Steering Committee decision\nmaking.\n8\n• Senior- and High-level Meetings and inputs to other meetings (Financing for\nDevelopment Forum, HLPF, etc.): UNDP and OECD provide substantive support\nbased on membership and type of event.\n• Monitoring:\no Pre-inception and inception phases: UNDP leads on partner country\noutreach and is the main responsible actor for this phase.\no Data collection and review: UNDP contributes on specific pre-agreed\ntasks.\no Country-level dialogue, action planning and follow up phases: UNDP leads\nand is the main responsible actor to support partner countries with country\nlevel action during this phase of the monitoring exercise.\no Results analysis and reporting: Joint responsibility of OECD and UNDP.\n• Advocacy and Strategic Communication, Learning and Knowledge\nManagement: UNDP leads advancement of the effectiveness agenda through\nstrategic communications, advocacy and knowledge management by positioning\nthe Global Partnership and country-level engagement within broader global\ndevelopment co-operation discourse/action.\n9\nKEY RESULTS ACHIEVED IN 2024\nOutput 1: Monitoring\nThe Global Partnership monitoring exercise is the main source of evidence that tracks\nstakeholders’ commitments on effectiveness, empowering partners and building trust in\nan era of global challenges. The data from the exercise helps countries and their\npartners to assess the progress they have made, while also being the official source of\ncountry and global level data on three SDG indicators: 5.c.1, 17.15.1 and 17.16.1.\nSince 2011, more than 100 partner countries have led the monitoring exercise in\ncollaboration with hundreds of development partners and other actors. The first three\nglobal monitoring rounds took place in 2014, 2016, and 2018. From 2020-2022, a\nparticipatory and comprehensive reform of the monitoring exercise – both what is\ncollected (the framework) and how (the process) – ensured the exercise continues to\nmeet its original aims and the evolving needs of stakeholders.\nRoll-Out of the 2023-2026 Monitoring Round\nThe 4th Global Partnership Monitoring Exercise was launched in January 2023, and as\nof December 2024, 59 partner countries committed to participate. In 2024, five\nadditional countries signed up for the exercise (Central African Republic, Kenya,\nMadagascar, Moldova and Somalia) and 34 of the participating 59 countries kicked off\nthe monitoring exercise in their country. Eleven countries completed data collection by\nthe end 2024. All of the above updates, including the results for those countries where it\nwas available in 2024, were reflected by UNDP JST on the Global Partnership’s website\nso interested parties could follow the progress of participating countries in real time.\nAt the country level, the monitoring exercise entails the following five phases:\nFigure 2: The five phases of the Global Partnership monitoring exercise\nSource: GPEDC Website\n10\nAmong other things, the UNDP JST leads support to partner countries on the pre-\ninception and inception phase of the monitoring exercise (phase 1). As such, in 2024,\nUNDP supported:\n• More than 65 pre-inception and inception briefings with 34 partner\ncountries;\n• Ongoing coordination with 28 United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) to\nsupport the exercise;\n• 11 multi-stakeholder kick-off consultations that launched the monitoring\nprocess;\n• Tailored briefings on data reporting and review with 15 partner countries;\n• Drafting of 7 roadmaps\n• Strengthened coordination with the UN Development Coordination Office\n(DCO) that led to increased UNCT support to the GPEDC monitoring\nexercise along with assistance from Resident Coordinator Offices (RCOs)\nto national co-ordinators, including in the identification of focal points to\nreport monitoring data.\nThe UNDP JST also leads on supporting partner countries with the reflection, dialogue\nand action phase of the monitoring (phase 5). With 11 countries completing the data\nsubmission and results dissemination phases (3 and 4) in 2024, UNDP JST prepared\nsubstantive materials and provided support to partner countries in preparation for phase\n5. This included the following:\n• Guidance note: an informative resource designed to support National Co-\nordinators and stakeholders with detailed guidance and examples on how to\nprepare for, and conduct the reflection, dialogue and action phase.\n• Communications flyer: a summarised version of the guidance note, providing\nNational Co-ordinators and stakeholders with a short snapshot of the main\ncharacteristics of action dialogues and the expectations of Phase 5.\n• Sense checking calls with UNDP Country Offices (COs): informal preparatory\nmeetings organized with UNDP COs and UN RCOs after each country concludes\nthe data collection phase, with the objectives of exchanging impressions of the\nmonitoring findings, exploring potential synergies for anchoring Phase 5 to\nexisting coordination mechanisms at country level, and strengthening UNDP CO\ncapacity to provide additional logistical and technical support to National\nCoordinators in preparing multi-stakeholder action dialogues.\n• Tailored briefing sessions: informative sessions delivered to National\nCoordinators after their monitoring results were provided. During these sessions,\nNational Coordinators were provided with a brief recap of their progress and\ncurrent country status in the monitoring exercise; a detailed description of the\nreflection, dialogue and action phase, including the specific activities and\nexpected outputs to be generated as part of the implementation of Phase 5; and\nan open-floor segment to address questions and discuss coordination with, and\npotential support from, UNDP COs and UN RCOs.\n11\n3rd Monitoring Training for Partner Countries\nBuilding on two trainings held in 2023 in Indonesia and Korea, the Government of\nCanada funded and organized a third training opportunity for African countries\nparticipating in the current round of the monitoring exercise. The training was hosted by\nEthiopia under the leadership and guidance of the Global Partnership Co-Chairs. UNDP\nJST was a close partner in the delivery of the training, providing substantive and\norganisational support.\nThe training took place from 3-5 June 2024 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and was delivered\nby the OECD-UNDP JST of the Global Partnership to a group of 36 participants\ncomprising of the Global Partnership Co-Chairs, representatives from Canada and\nUNDP, and representatives from 19 partner country governments, including Benin,\nCabo Verde, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Lesotho,\nLiberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Togo,\nUganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\nOver three days, participants engaged in workshop discussions to foster peer-to-peer\nlearning and develop a thorough understanding of the process and framework of the\nGlobal Partnership monitoring exercise and reflect on ways in which the exercise could\nmake development co-operation in their countries more effective. The training covered\nfive modules:\n• Module 1: Introduction to the Global Partnership and the broader development\neffectiveness agenda\n• Module 2: Introduction to the Global Partnership’s monitoring exercise and\noverview of the process\n• Module 3: Fundamentals of the monitoring framework\n• Module 4: Stakeholder engagement and institutionalisation\n• Module 5: Use of results and peer learning opportunities\nAn additional extra-official session was held on the South-South Co-operation Self-\nAssessment, where the main conclusions of the work piloted by Colombia in 2022 were\npresented, and participants’ interest in a potential new round of pilot work was\nassessed.\nResults from a short exit survey completed by participants indicated that the training\nprogramme objectives were achieved. Participants in the training indicated having\nstrengthened their understanding of the Global Partnership monitoring framework and\nprocess and appreciated the opportunity to enhance their strategies for approaching\nand engaging with different development stakeholders to complete the monitoring\nexercise. The exchange of country experiences from previous monitoring rounds was\nalso appreciated by participants.\n12\nImage 1: Participants at the 2024 Training on the Global Partnership Monitoring\nSource: UNDP JST\nImage 2: Training participants engaging in small-group discussions\nSource: UNDP JST\nOutput 2: Policy Action\nSupport to Steering Committee Meetings\nUNDP, together with OECD, provided substantive and operational support to the Global\nPartnership Co-Chairs and the Steering Committee members in organising two virtual\nSteering Committee meetings in 2024. Within the JST, UNDP leads on engagement\nwith partner country Steering Committee members, as well as the following\n13\nmembers: Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS), African Union Development\nAgency - New Partnership for Africa’s Development (AUDA-NEPAD), and the\nGroup of Seven Plus (g7+).\nThe 27th Steering Committee Meeting was held virtually from 12-13 June 2024. In\nattendance were 25 representatives from partner countries, as well as\nrepresentatives from PIFS, NEPAD and g7+. In addition to supporting these partner\ncountries and representatives, UNDP JST helped secure the attendance of Burkina\nFaso as an observer to the meeting, and foster partner country participation. Members\nassessed progress against the 2023-2026 Work Programme, discussed the rollout of\nthe 4th Monitoring Round, developed a joint vision for development effectiveness ahead\nof preparatory meetings for the 4th International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment (FfD4) and explored resourcing needs for the ongoing work of the\nPartnership. With support from the UNDP JST, Burkina Faso, Nepal and the Philippines\nshared their experiences as three of the countries undertaking the monitoring exercise,\nsharing different strategies for overcoming effectiveness challenges at country level\nthrough the monitoring process. Japan was welcomed as a new member of the Steering\nCommittee, taking over from the Republic of Korea as one of the representatives of\ndevelopment partners. This was also the final meeting for Mr. Vitalice Meja from Reality\nof Aid Africa, who since 2018 held the seat for the “Non-Executive Co-Chair”\nrepresenting non-governmental voices on the Steering Committee. From the second\nhalf of 2024, Ms. Nurgul Dzhanaeva (President of the Forum of Women’s NGOs of\nKyrgyzstan) and Mr. Luca De Fraia (Deputy Secretary General of Action Aid Italy) took\nup shared responsibility for the Non-Executive Co-Chair seat as an ad interim\narrangement.\nThe 28th Steering Committee Meeting was held virtually from 26-27 November 2024.\nIn attendance were 20 representatives from partner countries, as well as\nrepresentatives from PIFS, NEPAD and g7+. In addition to supporting these partner\ncountries and representatives, UNDP JST helped secure the attendance of Uganda as\nan observer to the meeting, fostering increased partner country participation. Meeting at\nthe mid-point of the 2023-2026 Work Programme, and following inclusive consultations,\nmembers finalized and approved the 2025/26 Action Plan. In addition, members\nassessed progress on the ongoing monitoring round and strategized on how best to\nrevitalise and garner political support for development effectiveness in the run up to\nFfD4. Australia was welcomed as a new member of the Steering Committee, taking over\nfrom Canada as a representative of development partners.\nUNDP JST also supported the participation of the representative of the UN development\nsystem in the Steering Committee, a seat currently held by the UN Development\nCoordination Office (DCO). UNDP JST provided briefing notes and substantive\nmaterial for DCO participation in Steering Committee Meetings as well as ongoing\nengagement with the Global Partnership. UNDP JST works closely with DCO to provide\nsupport to UN Resident Coordinators, UNDP Resident Representatives and UN Country\nTeams in countries undertaking the monitoring exercise.\n14\nNepal becomes the First Country to Move into the Learning, Dialogue and\nAction Phase of the Monitoring Exercise\nThe final reflection, dialogue and action phase (“phase 5”) of the Global Partnership\nmonitoring exercise is a unique opportunity for all actors to reflect on the results,\ndiscuss underlying explanations of the monitoring findings, and collectively identify and\nagree on ways to make development co-operation more effective. It is a crucial feature\nof the Global Partnership monitoring exercise that aims at generating behaviour change\nfor stronger development impact through inclusive follow-up and country-level dialogue,\nlearning, and joint action.\nIn 2024, Nepal became the first country to complete this final phase of the monitoring\nwhen it held its multi-stakeholder Action Dialogue on 21 November 2024. It was an\nopportunity to reflect on the monitoring results and agree on joint actions to enhance the\neffectiveness of development co-operation at country level. The dialogue was based on\nthe country’s findings - published here in July 2024 - from the Global Partnership\nmonitoring exercise. The results draw on consultations and data on effective\ndevelopment co-operation reported by over 30 development partners and other\nstakeholders. Receiving these results initiated the monitoring exercise’s final phase,\nwhich focuses on reflection, dialogue and action.\nUNDP JST closely supported Nepal’s action dialogue. This included holding calls with\nthe National Coordinator, UNDP CO and UN RCO, as well as producing logistical,\ntechnical and substantive materials, including: a “results dissemination communication”\nto support the National Coordinator in disseminating the results among Nepal’s\ndevelopment partners and stakeholders while announcing their action dialogue; a draft\naction dialogue concept note and proposed agenda based on consultations with the\nNational Coordinator’s team; an action dialogue ‘save the date’; personalized invitations\ntemplate; a set of draft emails and reminders in preparation to the action dialogue; a list\nof participants; a visual aid for the National Coordinator to present the monitoring results\nduring the dialogue; a form to collect inputs from development partners and\nstakeholders designed to support the National Coordinator in drafting the action-\noriented outcome document; and a draft story of progress highlighting key action-\noriented commitments.\nFollowing several months of careful planning, the dialogue on the monitoring results led\nto action-oriented commitments across seven key areas, including the adoption of a\nnew Development Finance Information Management system, a review of Nepal’s 2019\nInternational Development Co-operation Policy and the consolidation of Nepal’s INFF.\n15\nImage 3: Participants in Nepal’s Action Dialogue\nSource: International Economic Co-operation Coordination Division, Ministry of Finance,\nNepal\nImage 4: A presentation is made during Nepal’s Action Dialogue\nSource: International Economic Co-operation Coordination Division, Ministry of Finance,\nNepal\nPreparations for the 4th International Conference on Financing for\nDevelopment\nAt the 27th Steering Committee Meeting in June 2024, members agreed that the Fourth\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4), to be held in Spain in\nJuly 2025, presents a rare political opportunity to boost global awareness and action on\n16\ndevelopment effectiveness. Throughout 2024, UNDP JST was therefore involved in\nsupporting Co-Chairs and Steering Committee members in raising the profile of\ndevelopment effectiveness on the road to FfD4.\nIn July 2024, the FfD4 Co-Facilitators called for inputs to an Elements Paper which\nwould put forward potential elements of the FFD4 Outcome Document. In response,\nUNDP JST supported the preparation of a joint Global Partnership input and\ncoordinated the integration of feedback by partner country Steering Committee\nMembers. Based on the Global Partnership’s input to the Elements Paper, UNDP JST\nalso developed key effectiveness messages for FfD4.\nFurthermore, UNDP JST provided detailed coverage of the FfD4 Preparatory Process\nfor Co-Chairs and Steering Committee members. The team also developed a series of\nnews articles that focused on FfD4 and highlighted development effectiveness-related\nreferences by UN Member States and other groups. This included:\no FfD Forum (22-25 April): “Partners Demand Greater Focus on\nDevelopment Effectiveness at this Year’s UN FfD Forum”\no First Preparatory Committee (22-26 July): “Revitalizing the Development\nEffectiveness Agenda: Insights from the FfD4 Preparatory Committee”\no Intersessional Multi-Stakeholder Hearing (28 October): “Universalizing the\nDevelopment Effectiveness Principles: Insights from the FfD4 Multi-\nStakeholder Hearing”\no Second Preparatory Committee (3-6 December): “Putting Countries ‘In the\nDriver’s Seat’: Insights from the Second FfD4 Preparatory Committee”\nFinally, at the Second FfD4 Preparatory Committee Meeting in December 2024, UNDP\nJST supported the Co-Chairs of the Global Partnership to host an Informal Meeting on\nDevelopment Effectiveness and FfD4. The informal meeting convened over 25\nrepresentatives interested in development effectiveness and discussed how to\nraise the profile of the effectiveness agenda on the road to FfD4. In attendance were\ndelegates from Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, European Commission, Japan, Mexico,\nRussian Federation, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Zambia and\nrepresentatives from Eurodad, g7+ Secretariat, IBON International, Millenium Challenge\nCorporation, OECD, Reality of Aid Africa, TOSSD, UN DESA, WINGS, and World Bank\nGroup. Participants exchanged views on how effectiveness was reflected in the\nElements Paper and highlighted what they would like to prioritize on effectiveness in the\nforthcoming FfD4 outcome document. UNDP JST drafted a summary of the key\ndiscussions, which was circulated to participants on behalf of Global Partnership Co-\nChairs. UNDP JST also supported the establishment of a group of effectiveness\n‘champions’ in New York to continue effectiveness conversations ahead of FfD4.\n17\nImage 5: Participants at the Informal Meeting on Development Effectiveness and FfD4\n(December 2024)\nSource: UNDP JST\nOutput 3: Advocacy and Communications\nWithin the JST, UNDP leads the Global Partnership’s advocacy and outreach activities,\nincluding implementing the 2023-2026 Advocacy & Outreach Plan. The objective of the\nGlobal Partnership’s advocacy and outreach is to foster political awareness to provoke\nbehaviour change and uptake of effective development co-operation and systematic\nlearning, in turn promoting action towards achieving the Sustainable Development\nGoals (SDGs).\nEngagement in Strategic Events\nHigh-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF)\nIn 2024, UNDP JST organized a high-level side event on the margins of the High-Level\nPolitical Forum on Sustainable Development in July. A year before FfD4, the event\nofficially marked the launch of advocacy efforts ahead of FfD4. The side event, entitled\n“Road to FfD4: Laying the groundwork for a new era of transparency and\ndevelopment effectiveness,” was jointly hosted by the Global Partnership, the\nInternational Aid Transparency Initiative, and the Government of Nigeria. UNDP JST led\non substantive development of the concept note and run of show, coordinated speakers\nand organised logistics including interpretation and catering. During and after the side\nevent, UNDP JST drafted and disseminated media advisories, executed communication\ncampaigns and press releases. Attended by over 60 in-person stakeholders from\npartner countries, development partners, and civil society organizations (CSOs), the\n18\nevent addressed the impact of the development effectiveness agenda in the decade\nsince the Third International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD3) and set\nout why the effectiveness principles should be recognised in the final FfD4 outcome\ndocument. The event included interventions from two of the partner countries (Chad\nand Nigeria) that are currently undertaking the monitoring exercise. The news article\nfrom the side event, developed by UNDP JST, can be found here.\nFigure 3: Flyer developed by UNDP JST for the side event at the 2024 HLPF\nSource: UNDP JST\nImage 6: Panelists at the 2024 HLPF side event\nSource: UNDP JST\nHigh-Level Forum on Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships\nIn addition to hosting the high-level side event at HLPF, in 2024 UNDP JST also\nprovided input and support to events hosted by partners, including the High-Level\nForum on Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships, hosted by Indonesia in September. A side\n19\nevent entitled “How the GPEDC Global Monitoring Exercise is Making Development\nCo-operation More Effective and Country-Owned” was hosted by the Co-Chairs of\nthe Global Partnership (Indonesia, Sweden, Democratic Republic of Congo, and the\nCSO Partnership for Development Effectiveness), with substantive support to the\nconcept note and communications around the event by the UNDP JST. The side event\nhighlighted that while mobilizing resources remains essential to advance development\nobjectives, ensuring the quality of finance and partnerships is equally critical.\nImage 7: Panellists at the High-Level Forum on Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships side\nevent\nSource: BAPPENAS\nODA Learning Series Workshop for Emerging Donors in Europe and Central Asia\nIn 2024, UNDP JST also participated virtually in the “ODA Learning Series workshop\nfor Emerging Donors in Europe and Central Asia” held in May in Slovakia. In a\nsession entitled “Partnerships for Development: Empowering National Stakeholders in\nODA,” UNDP JST presented the importance of the effectiveness principles in\ndevelopment co-operation, their connection to multi-stakeholder engagement and\nhighlighted the Global Partnership’s offerings to emerging donors in the region.\nCommunications and Advocacy Products Developed and Disseminated in\n2024\nIn October 2024, upon the advice of UNDP JST, Co-Chairs agreed that a new website\nfor the Global Partnership should be developed. The new website would move away\nfrom the underutilized community-based platform, to one that is accessible, easily\nunderstood, and showcases the Global Partnership’s impact and monitoring results at\ncountry level. Therefore in 2024, UNDP JST led on the development of Terms of\nReference for the procurement of a developer for the new website, to be launched in\nmid-2025.\n20\nThe following advocacy products were developed by UNDP JST in 2024, in line with the\n2023-2026 Advocacy & Outreach Plan.\n• Key advocacy messages for the following events:\no 68th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (11-22 March)\no 2024 UN Financing for Development Forum (22-25 April)\no 4th International Conference on Small Island Developing States (27-30\nMay)\no 2024 High-Level Political Forum (17-18 July)\no High-Level Forum on Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships (1-3 September)\no Summit of the Future and 79th Session of the UN General Assembly (10-\n24 September)\no 5th UN World Data Forum (12-15 November)\no Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (30 June –\n3 July 2025)\n• Flyer highlighting why different partners join the monitoring round\n• Flyer on Phase 5 of the 2023-2026 Monitoring Round\n• Effectiveness Dictionary\n• Short videos highlighting the importance of development effectiveness in the\nlead up to FfD4:\no https://x.com/DevCooperation/status/1848334867295076681\no https://x.com/DevCooperation/status/1854570102059868468\no https://x.com/DevCooperation/status/1864310187034857903\nUNDP JST supports the outreach, editing, publication and promotion of opinion pieces\nand articles from expert practitioners working on effective development co-operation. In\naddition, UNDP JST drafts stories that highlight the progress countries have made in\nbuilding key policies, processes and plans for more effective development co-operation\nat the country level. The following stories and blogs were published on the Global\nPartnership website in 2024 (cross-posted content is italicized):\n• GPEDC 2023 Retrospective: Learnings from Global Partnership Events\n• Aid to Afghanistan: An Insider’s Take on Lessons to be Learnt\n• GPEDC 2023 Retrospective: Highlights from the KOICA LAP and Indonesia\nTraining\n• The road to equitable partnerships\n• Towards Stronger Partnerships for More Effective Development Co-operation:\nUganda Launches its 2023-2026 Monitoring Exercise\n• DevelopmentAid Dialogues | Profit and Purpose: Aligning Business & Social\nGood in Development Partnerships\n• Rethinking Development Co-operation: Aid 2.0\n• The Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS calls for development effectiveness:\n11 SIDS have committed to monitor their progress\n• Nigeria’s Vision for FfD4: A New Era for Transparency and Development\nEffectiveness\n21\n• Indonesia Amplifies Effectiveness in Global Forums: Improving the Quality of\nDevelopment Co-operation through the GPEDC Monitoring Exercise\n• Peru Makes Great Strides in Strengthening Effective Development Co-operation\n• Data for Effective Development: Insights ahead of the UN World Data Forum\n2024\n• Rebooting Development Effectiveness on the Road to FfD4: An Essential\nPathway to Sustainable Development\nWhile a wealth of country stories was published, there were fewer than initially planned\nin 2024 as these stories focus on country-level impact and many of the countries\nparticipating in the Global Partnership monitoring were in inception or data collection\nphases in 2024.\nUNDP JST drafts and disseminates key messages, information on upcoming events,\nand monitoring updates through its newsletter. In 2024, the following 11 Global\nPartnership newsletters were shared with an audience of over 8000 subscribers:\n• February\n• March\n• April\n• May\n• June\n• July\n• August\n• September\n• October\n• November\n• December / “Our 2024 Year of Delivery”\nIn addition, 11 videos were developed on the 11 Country Results Briefs completed in\n2024 as part of promoting the Global Partnership monitoring round. Due to delays in\nexternal feedback before their release, these were finalized and disseminated in 2025,\nas part of promotional materials in the lead up to the FfD4.\n22\nCONCLUSIONS AND WAY FORWARD\nAs demonstrated in this report, 2024 was an eventful year for UNDP JST, the Effective\nDevelopment Cooperation team in BERA, with tangible outputs in support of the\ndevelopment effectiveness agenda. Significant progress was made to advance the\nGlobal Project on Managing Development Co-operation Effectively (see the results log\nframe in Annex III). In brief, this includes: the roll-out of the 4th monitoring round in over\n50 partner countries and completion of the first Action Dialogue; the delivery of a\nmonitoring training workshop; policy advocacy on the road to FfD4; two high-level side\nevents; support to two Steering Committee Meetings; and the development and\ndistribution of a variety of targeted advocacy and communications materials.\nIn terms of resourcing the team to achieve the abovementioned results, the work\nundertaken in 2024 has been made possible through generous contributions from\nCanada, the European Commission, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Sweden and\nSwitzerland (see Annex II). The table set out in Annex I provides the financial report of\navailable resources and expenditures under the Global Project for Managing\nDevelopment Co-operation Effectively in 2024.\nLooking ahead to 2025, FfD4 in July will be a critical point for the Global Partnership’s\npolicy and advocacy work. The outcomes of the conference will have implications for\nthe direction of the Global Partnership’s work going forward, and the 8th Busan Global\nPartnership Forum, planned for September 2025, will be the first opportunity after FfD4\nfor stocktaking on the development effectiveness agenda. UNDP JST will need to\nproactively engage in the FfD4 process and seek to raise the profile of development\neffectiveness in the negotiated outcome document. The upcoming year is also critical to\nthe success of the 4th Global Partnership monitoring round, with January 2025 set as\nthe deadline for countries to enter the data collection phase of the exercise. Many\ncountries will finalize data collection in 2025 and enter the dialogue and action phase, a\ncritical moment for country-level reflection and policy change in development co-\noperation. Throughout 2025, UNDP JST will work closely with partner countries and UN\nCountry Teams to support the monitoring, particularly those countries in the final phase\nof reflection, dialogue and action.\nIn addition to the policy and advocacy work related to FfD4, and more broadly the\ncommunications work led by UNDP JST, alongside UNDP JST’s support to partner\ncountries to carry out the Global Partnership’s monitoring exercise, the team in 2025 will\nneed to provide strategic guidance to Global Partnership Co-Chairs and members on\nforward planning for the Partnership beyond the end of the 2026 Work Programme. This\nwill require bringing together the: direction set by the FfD4 outcome document; forward-\nlooking vision of Co-Chairs and members; and, opportunities and risks for the Global\nPartnership in light of the broader geopolitical and development landscape as well as\nthe last remaining years before the close of the implementation period of the 2030\nAgenda. UNDP JST, together with UN DCO and UN DESA, will continue to work closely\ntogether to ensure that development effectiveness – commitments made and progress\ntoward (as well as lack thereof) – continue to enable partner countries to drive more\n23\neffective development cooperation in their countries that can in turn lead to long-lasting\nresults and impact.\nWith many thanks to the team’s current donors, funding has been secured for the team\nto continue its work through 2025. Separately, but also linked to the future plans for the\nGlobal Partnership, consideration in 2025 will need to be given to the team’s future\nbeyond the end of the 2025, to seek funding if needed for 2026 and plan for next steps\nfor the Global Partnership as well as the UNDP JST beyond the conclusion of the 2023-\n2026 Work Programme.\n24\nANNEX I: FINANCIAL PROJECT EXECUTION IN\n2024\nI.

This framework remains the cornerstone for countries in\nshaping and guiding national sustainable development strategies. The Voluntary National Reviews\n(VNRs) are a key part of this process, offering countries a mechanism to assess their progress\ntowards the goals and targets on an annual basis.\nThe 2024 Voluntary National Reviews Through the Lens of Peace, Just and Strong Institutions\nexamine the extent to which member states have integrated SDG 16 in their national priorities and\nreporting. Have its targets been integrated into national development plans? Are they being\nmonitored and with what data and statistics? How inclusive is the process behind these plans?\nThis report aims to provide member states and stakeholders with the insights needed to enhance\ntheir efforts in promoting peace, justice, and strong institutions. It tracks how individual targets are\nbeing integrated, highlights where tangible progress is being made, and identifies the policies and\ninitiatives that are shaping that progress. Additionally, it highlights the interlinkages between SDG\n16 and other goals, underscoring the importance of more effective integration of SDG 16 in national\nplans and strategies for achieving progress.\nSince 2016, when 22 countries presented VNRs in the High-Level Political Forum (HLPF), there has\nbeen a steady increase in the number of reports, as well as an increase in the coverage of SDG 16\non peace, just and strong institutions.\nReview Criteria\nThis report reviews the 36 VNRs presented\nWestern Europe and other States\nin 2024. This year, four countries reported for 5.6%\nthe fourth time, 13 for the third time and 17 for\nthe second time.

For each chapter, this report\nprovides a quantitative and qualitative\nanalysis and illustrates country examples.\n5\nSDG 16 Priorities\nBetween 2016 and 2024, a substantial increase in reporting was made across all SDG 16 targets.\nThe most significant areas were:\nViolence reduction (Target 16.1)\nChild protection (Target 16.2) and Anti-corruption efforts (Target 16.5)\nStrengthening effective institutions (Target 16.6)\nWhile all targets showed an increase in coverage, Target 16.a (Human Rights Institutions) saw the\nsmallest gain. Additionally, legal identity (16.9) and fundamental freedoms (16.10), though improved,\nmay benefit from further support to sustain momentum.\nCorruption was the most frequently cited issue, with countries introducing new anti-corruption\nlaws, and others requiring asset declarations from officials. Violence was also widely reported,\n2016\nthough it varied in type and severity - discussing issues related to intimate partner violence,\nchild abuse and armed conflict.\nThe range of issues had expanded. Countries reported on violence, governance, rule of law,\nprotection of human rights, anti-corruption, and illicit financial flows. There was also emphasis\n2017\non public service delivery, access to information, and accountability, with some reviews\nhighlighting the enabling role of SDG 16 for broader development goals.\nMany countries underscored the enabling function of SDG 16. Several linked peacebuilding\nand conflict resolution to progress on SDG 16, particularly through gender-sensitive\napproaches in peace and security policy. Corruption remained a central challenge, along with\n2018\nweak institutions, limited legal frameworks, slow justice systems, and gaps in legal identity\nregistration.\nNearly all countries had integrated SDG 16 into their VNRs. Member States emphasized\nreducing violence, protecting human rights, improving transparency and institutional\neffectiveness, and upholding the rule of law. Special attention was given to protecting\n2019\nvulnerable populations, children, youth, women, persons with disabilities, and LGBTI\nindividuals. Additionally, many countries reported progress in women’s political participation\nand birth registration as well as legal identity.\n6\nDespite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, 47 countries completed their VNRs\nand presented them at the High-Level Political Forum. The pandemic had a significant social\nand economic impact, deepening inequalities and vulnerabilities. Regarding SDG 16,\ncountries focused on reducing violence, child abuse, and corruption, while promoting the rule\n2020\nof law, legal identity, and transparent institutions. Challenges included a shortage of legal\nprofessionals, public distrust in the justice system, and case backlogs. Some countries\nintroduced national strategies to combat organized crime, terrorism, and financial crimes.\nAccess to justice emerged in the VNRs as a main priority, with efforts to expand legal aid,\nreform courts, and ensure judicial independence. Transparency and anti-corruption measures\nwere widely reported, including oversight reforms, national strategies, and whistleblower\nprotections. Many countries emphasized participatory governance, with initiatives to include\n2021\nmarginalized groups in decision-making. Conflict-affected states focused on peacebuilding\nand violence prevention, while COVID-19 was noted for straining institutions and limiting civic\nfreedoms. Data gaps remained a major challenge, especially for sensitive targets like illicit\nflows and freedom of expression.\nVNRs emphasized the connection between peace, governance, the rule of law, and\nsustainable development. Countries reported on efforts to strengthen justice systems,\npromote judicial independence, and fight corruption and terrorism. Participatory approaches,\ninclusivity, and human rights were seen as essential for social cohesion and development.\n2022\nThe reports also highlighted the importance of international cooperation and transparent\ngovernance in supporting economic recovery and implementation of the 2030 Agenda,\nespecially in conflict-affected settings.\nVNRs prioritized peace and security, highlighting efforts to reduce violence and support\nconflict prevention. Access to justice and legal identity were central, with reforms expanding\nlegal aid and strengthening civil registration systems. Transparency and accountability\ncontinued to be widely addressed. Many countries acknowledged gaps in SDG 16 data and\nresponded by investing in statistical capacity and incorporating citizen-generated and\n2023\nqualitative data. Institutional integration of SDG 16 into national development plans was a key\ntrend. Countries linked SDG 16 to education, gender equality, climate action, and poverty\nreduction, acknowledging that inclusive and accountable institutions are the bedrock of\nsustainable and resilient societies.\n7\nGraphic percentage of countries Target covered\nincluding SDG 16 targets in the Voluntary\nNational Reviews 2016 vs 2024\nTarget not covered\n2016 41%\nTarget 16.1:\nViolence\n2024 100%\n2016 45%\nTarget 16.2:\nChild Protection\n2024 92%\n2016 64%\nTarget 16.3:\nAccess to Justice\n2024 89%\n2016 23%\nTarget 16.4:\nOrganized Crime\n2024 69%\n2016 45%\nTarget 16.5:\nCorruption\n2024 92%\n2016 55%\nTarget 16.6:\nEffective Institutions\n2024 94%\n9\n2016 41%\nTarget 16.7:\nInclusive Decision-\nmaking 2024 89%\n2016 45%\nTarget 16.8:\nGlobal Governance\n2024 78%\n2016 23%\nTarget 16.9:\nLegal Identity\n2024 69%\nTarget 16.10: 2016 55%\nFundamental\nFreedoms\n2024 86%\n2016 45%\nTarget 16.a:\nHuman Rights\nInstitutions 2024 75%\n2016 64%\nTarget 16.b:\nDiscrimination\n2024 92%\n10\nIntegration of the SDGs in National\nPlans and Strategies\nInstitutional arrangements for integrating SDGs in sustainable development plans are a critical issue because\nthey directly affect how effectively countries can deliver commitments related to peace, justice, and strong\ninstitutions. Strong and inclusive institutional arrangements are also essential for fostering country\nownership, ensuring that SDG 16 priorities are integrated into national strategies and reflect the needs and\naspirations of diverse stakeholders. Without such arrangements, accountability, coordination, and sustained\nprogress are likely to remain limited.\nAll the VNR countries for 2024 have embedded SDGs into national strategies, financing frameworks, and\npolicies. The extent to which SDGs have been incorporated into national frameworks varies. Some countries\nhave fully integrated SDGs into their policy plans. Other countries mention that they have integrated the\nSDGs into their national policy frameworks but offer limited information on the specifics or on the process of\nintegration. Only a small number of countries refer to supporting these strategies with SDG-aligned budgets\nor Integrated National Financing Frameworks, revealing an ongoing disconnect between stated\ncommitments and actual financing [1].

The innovative ways in which SDG 16 is\nhighlighted reflect the wide range of dynamic approaches available to advance collective\ncommitments to peace, justice, and strong institutions. While countries continue to present\nprogress on the SDGs in different formats, nine years into implementation, we are seeing certain\nthematic areas of SDG 16 emerging as universally relevant and recognized priorities across diverse\nnational contexts.\nYes No\nFigure 1 - Percentage that had\nsections/chapters on SDG 16\n81%\nThe aspects of SDG 16 that are more prominently highlighted across multiple 2024 VNRs\ninclude:\nInclusion. Many countries demonstrated a deeper commitment to creating spaces for multi-\nstakeholder participation. Nearly all VNRs highlighted stakeholder contributions to the 2030\nAgenda. These consultations ensured participation from citizens across the country,\nrepresenting various sectors and identities, from women to youth to indigenous groups.\nAdvancing gender equality, empowering young leaders, and ensuring the civic participation of\nthose impacted by conflict, climate change, and poverty are among the practices that were\nincreasingly highlighted.\nLocalization. Countries are investing more in multi-level governance approaches to\ndevelopment. Among the 2024 VNRs, 33% referenced Voluntary Local Reviews [2] – a\nsignificant increase from 16% in 2022 [3]. Some VNRs report that they have or are in the\nprocess of establishing local government bodies or are already engaging regularly with rural-\nbased organizations, indigenous communities and faith-based groups to support SDG\nimplementation.\nSDG 16 Interlinkages. Many countries increasingly acknowledge the interlinkages between\nSDG 16 and other SDGs. In 2024, several examples of the links between SDG 13 on climate\naction and SDG 16 are highlighted. Some of the VNRs demonstrate that developing climate\npolicies, such as early warning systems, that involve those most vulnerable to climate disasters,\ncan enhance public trust and promote inclusive governance approaches. The connections\nbetween SDG 5 on gender equality and SDG 16 are also increasingly recognized and\nreinforced. Examples include the implementation of gender budgeting tools, the empowerment\nof women leaders, and the application of gender-sensitive approaches in peacebuilding efforts.\n13\nTransparency and anti-corruption. There is a continued focus on reducing corruption and\nenhancing accountability. 81% of the 2024 VNRs reference anti-corruption measures, fraud,\nbribery or illicit financial flows as challenges to the achievement of SDGs. Many 2024 VNRs\nemphasize the role of oversight bodies – such as Supreme Audit Institutions, anti-corruption\ncommissions, ombudsman, and national human rights institutions to reinforce transparency and\naccountability. The VNRs recognize that although legal and oversight reforms are underway in\nseveral countries, political corruption and organized crime continue to have severe and far-\nreaching impacts.\nSDG 16 Monitoring and Reporting. The 2024 VNRs mark a notable shift toward inclusive, and\ninnovative SDG 16 data systems. Countries are not only expanding their indicator sets and\ndigital tools but are also recognizing the value of qualitative narratives and citizen-generated\ndata. For instance, Mexico integrates both qualitative insights and citizen-generated data into\nits SDG 16 reporting, while Kenya incorporates geospatial, administrative, and citizen-\ngenerated data into its broader SDG monitoring efforts. Despite these advancements, many\ncountries—particularly fragile states - continue to face significant challenges due to the lack of\ndisaggregated data, underscoring the urgent need for greater support for national statistical\nsystems.\nArmenia Sierra Leone\nArmenia’s VNR included a dedicated chapter Sierra Leone’s VNR states that “After being\non ‘peace’ that reflects Armenia’s experience an accelerator SDG for the first half of the\nnavigating the impacts of COVID-19, military 2030 agenda, SDG 16 has been further\naggression, and a major humanitarian crisis.

Numerous countries have underscored the\nimportance of strong, inclusive, and accountable institutions as foundational to progress across all\nsectors.\nFor instance, Austria integrates gender equality, youth engagement, and international cooperation\nas cross-cutting priorities, applying SDG 16 principles, such as gender-responsive budgeting and\nanti-violence initiatives, throughout its national agenda. Belize addresses child marriage not only\nunder SDG 5 but also in relation to SDGs 1, 4, 8, 10, and 16, illustrating how sustainable peace and\njustice are contingent upon the elimination of harmful practices. Similarly, Brazil incorporates\ntransparency, human rights, and corporate accountability into its economic and environmental\nstrategies, thereby reinforcing the synergies between SDG 16 and SDGs 8, 12, and 17.\nOther Member States are advancing the cross-cutting relevance of SDG 16 through national\nplanning and legislative alignment. Costa Rica has identified hundreds of legislative linkages, with\nSDG 16 among the most frequently referenced. Honduras emphasizes that enhanced governance\ncontributes to improved outcomes in education, health, and other key sectors. Nepal’s inclusive\ndemocratic approach promotes participation, social equity, and environmental commitments,\ndemonstrating the broad applicability of SDG 16 principles. In conflict-affected settings such as\nSouth Sudan, SDG 16 is viewed as foundational for rebuilding institutions and needed for progress\nin areas ranging from education to economic resilience. Spain calls SDG 16 the human rights SDG.\nIt highlights the integration of human rights across all SDGs, positioning SDG 16 both as a\nstandalone objective and as a guiding framework for implementation. Meanwhile, Vanuatu\nexemplifies the mutually reinforcing relationship between governance and climate action, where\ninvestments in local institutions and civic engagement have led to more equitable and resilient\nclimate responses.\nCollectively, these examples underscore that SDG 16 is not only a goal in its own right, but also a\nvital enabler of sustainable development across the entire 2030 Agenda.\nNo Yes\nFigure 2 - Percentage that linked\nSDG 16 with other SDGs\n44%\n16\nAustria Brazil\nAustria’s VNR recognizes gender equality as Brazil’s VNR highlights the integration of\na foundational pillar for the successful SDG 16 principles, such as transparency,\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda across integrity, corporate accountability, and human\nall levels, - local to global.

This poses a significant challenge for monitoring SDG Target 16.1, which\nseeks to reduce all forms of violence and related death rates.\nCasualty recording—the rigorous documentation of patterns of harm to civilians—plays a vital\nrole in monitoring human rights violations. It involves granular data collection, including victim and\nperpetrator identities, dates, locations, and weapons of violence. However, this essential work is often\nimpeded by information blackouts, population displacement, infrastructure collapse, surveillance, and\nsecurity risks to data collectors.\nDespite these barriers, OHCHR remains mandated to protect civilians and uphold their rights. In\nresponse, methodological innovations rooted in data science have been integrated into human rights\nmonitoring to enhance both data completeness and accuracy.\nIn many conflict zones, multiple independent sources—civil society records, hospital and morgue\ndata, government and prison registries, and OHCHR’s own documentation—often contain overlapping\nbut incomplete information. Some victims appear in several datasets; others in none.

The global prison population was estimated at 11.7 million individuals in 2023, representing\na global prison-population rate of 145 prisoners per 100,000 population. A third (3.7 million) of the\nglobal prison population was held in pre-trial detention, a share that has remained stable between\n2015 and 2023.\nSex-disaggregated data on the reporting of violence are limited, and only reveal a clear pattern\nin Latin America and the Caribbean, where women are more likely to report their experiences of\nphysical assault than men While no single indicator can precisely capture the complex and multifaceted nature of rule of law and\naccess to justice, the percentage of pre-trial (‘unsentenced’) detainees within the prison population can\nserve as a proxy indicator for measuring access to legal aid, the efficiency of the criminal justice system\nand captures one of the many dimensions of access to justice29. This measure signifies overall respect for\nthe principle that persons awaiting trial should not be detained in custody unnecessarily, which, in turn,\nis premised on aspects of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty30 and the rights to due\nEurope and Northern America (11 countries) Latin America and the Caribbean (11 countries)\nSub-Saharan Africa (13 countries) Other regions (16 countries) process and freedom from arbitrary detention.

While the global prison population has grown over recent decades, the rate of increase has\nbeen slower than the growth of the world’s population. As a result, between 2015 and 2023 the global\nprisoner-to-population ratio has fallen from 149 to 145 prisoners per 100,000 population.\nThe prisoner-to-population ratio varies across regions and, in 2023, the lowest level of 54 prisoners per\n100,000 population was observed in Central Asia and Southern Asia, followed by Sub-Saharan Africa\n(82 prisoners per 100,000 population). The highest ratio of 305 prisoners per 100,000 population was\nobserved in the Latin America and the Caribbean followed by Europe and Northern America (257 prisoners\nper 100,000 population).\nBetween 2015 and 2023, in some regions, imprisonment rates increased significantly, from 259 to 305\nprisoners per 100,000 population in Latin America and the Caribbean and from 137 to 160 per 100,000\npopulation in Northern Africa and Western Asia. The opposite trend was observed in Europe and Northern\nAmerica, where the prisoner-to-population rate decreased from 326 to 257 prisoners per 100,000\npopulation over the same period, still remaining much higher than the global average.\nMen make up over 94 per cent of the prison population, or 11.0 million prisoners in 2023, while less than\na million (760,000) women were held in prison. The share of women among all prisoners has remained\nMen\nrelatively stable between 2015 and 2023, staying below 7 per cent during the entire period. However, the\nshare of female prisoners shows some regional variations, ranging from 3.3 per cent in Northern Africa and\nWestern Asia to 8.3 per cent in Europe and Northern America, in 2023.\n29 United Nations System Common Position on Incarceration, p.3\n30 See United Nations Standards Minimum Rules for Non-Custodial Measures (the Tokyo Rules), rule 6.1\nGlobal Progress Report on Sustainable Development Goal 16 Global Progress Report on Sustainable Development Goal 16\n50 51\nIndicators on Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies.

The statistical and development communities continue to examine\nwhere there are still gaps in our knowledge and how they can be filled. This is why Member States adopted\na new indicator (16.3.3) on access to civil justice. The new indicator was adopted in March 2020, as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic was unfolding. The pandemic severely hampered statistical systems’ capacity to\nconduct population surveys and compile data for this new indicator, making it difficult to assess global\nprogress. However, despite these initial setbacks and constraints in data collection, there has been an\nencouraging increase in the number of countries that have begun to collect data and report on this\nindicator or that are planning data collection activities and reporting. Some countries are already making\nsignificant advances by conducting legal needs surveys that include the required questions to compute\nSDG 16.3.3, or by integrating access to justice survey modules in broader governance surveys.\nCurrently, data for the new indicator are available for ten countries.\nIn early 2025, UNODC, in collaboration with the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) and national\npartners, has started the implementation of the Statistical Framework to Measure Corruption57 in\nColombia, the Dominican Republic and Kenya.

At least two countries are expected to report their first estimates of tax and\ncommercial IFFs in 2025.

Designed as a voluntary certification programme, the Seal provides a structured\nframework for public institutions to assess their internal practices, identify gaps, and implement\ntransformative changes that embed gender equality across all areas of work, from leadership and\nstaffing to budgeting and service delivery.\nAt the heart of the Seal is the principle that institutional change must be evidence-based.\nParticipating institutions begin the process by conducting a comprehensive self-assessment using a\nset of rigorous standards and indicators. This data-driven approach allows them to map the current\nstate of gender equality within the organization, looking at who holds power, how resources are\nallocated, whether services meet the needs of all groups, and whether internal systems are fair and\ninclusive. The insights gained from this diagnostic phase form the foundation for action plans and\nreform strategies that are tailored to the institution’s specific context and challenges.\nThe Seal has been rolled out in a diverse range of countries, each offering powerful examples of\nhow data and institutional commitment can drive lasting change. For example, in El Salvador, the\nMinistry of Environment used the Seal to mainstream gender across climate and environmental\npolicy, while the Ministry of Culture created gender units and new accountability mechanisms.

All rights reserved.\nUnited Nations Development Programme\nOne United Nations Plaza\nNew York, NY, 100017 USA\nwww.undp.org\nExecutive Summary\nOver the past ten years, UNDP has partnered with all 32 Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) to\nsupport the implementation of the Vienna Programme of Action, investing over USD 12.5 billion across\nareas such as governance, climate resilience, economic transformation, and financing for development.\nWith a universal presence in LLDCs, UNDP translated global expertise into context-specific solutions\nthrough its country offices. Below is a synopsis of UNDP's policy and programmatic work aligned with\nnational priorities.\nGovernance Systems and Institutional Capacity: Effective governance is essential for\n1\nsustainable development in LLDCs, shaping inclusive service delivery, trust, and institutional\nresilience. UNDP addresses challenges such as democratic backsliding, digital transformation,\nand weak accountability through support for decentralization, capacity building, and\nparticipatory governance. In countries such as Nepal, Moldova, Lao PDR, and Mali, these efforts\nhave strengthened institutions amid complex crises. Looking ahead, the Awaza Programme of\nAction and UNDP’s priorities in the coming years position governance as central to structural\ntransformation, with a focus on digital infrastructure, inclusive economic governance, and local\nengagement.\nRegional Connectivity and Trade in LLDCs: Over the past decade, UNDP has supported\n2\nLLDCs in enhancing trade infrastructure, harmonizing cross-border procedures, and aligning\nnational strategies with regional frameworks such as the African Continental Free Trade Area\n(AfCFTA). Through the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) and Aid for Trade programmes,\nUNDP has delivered impactful support in countries like South Sudan, Lesotho, Bhutan, and\nacross Central Asia — boosting MSME competitiveness, expanding access to digital and\nregional markets, and advancing inclusive trade policies. These efforts have improved\ninstitutional capacity, created jobs, strengthened value chains, and enabled women-led\nenterprises to access new trade opportunities. Looking ahead, UNDP will scale support for trade\nand transit reforms, digital trade, and sustainable value chain integration, aligned with the Awaza\nProgramme of Action and UNDP’s priorities.\nLocal Economic Development and MSMEs in LLDCs: MSMEs are the backbone of LLDC\n3\neconomies, yet face persistent barriers to finance, markets, and technology — challenges\ncompounded for women, youth, and informal workers. UNDP has supported all LLDCs in\nstrengthening inclusive local economies by enhancing MSME productivity, market access, digital\ninclusion, and value chain development. Through initiatives like the SDG Value Chains\nProgramme, Aid for Trade, and national platforms such as Malawi’s Innovation Challenge Fund\nand Botswana’s Supplier Development Programme, UNDP has expanded financing, created\njobs, empowered women entrepreneurs, and built resilience in sectors from agriculture to\ne-commerce. Looking ahead, UNDP will continue advancing inclusive, digitally enabled, and\ngender-responsive MSME ecosystems to drive equitable growth and local development across\nLLDCs.\n1\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nClimate Resilience and Energy Transitions in LLDCs: Landlocked Developing Countries face\n4\ncritical energy access gaps and heightened vulnerability to climate impacts, with over 215 million\npeople lacking reliable electricity and rural access far below global averages. UNDP has\nsupported 31 LLDCs through its Climate Promise initiative, helping countries enhance their\nclimate commitments, mobilize finance, and integrate mitigation and adaptation strategies.\nFlagship programmes like the Africa Minigrids Program and targeted support in countries such\nas Paraguay have advanced clean energy access, e-mobility, and nature-based solutions.\nThrough policy, technical, and financial assistance, UNDP is helping LLDCs diversify energy\nsources, close access gaps, and build climate-resilient, low-carbon economies, aligned with the\nAwaza Programme of Action.\nNatural Resource Management in LLDCs: Landlocked Developing Countries face acute\n5\nenvironmental pressures, ranging from land degradation and water scarcity to climate shocks,\ndue to their heavy reliance on agriculture, mining, and forestry, especially in fragile ecosystems.\nApproximately 54% of LLDCs’ land consists of drylands, home to 60% of their populations,\nmaking these countries particularly vulnerable to climate change and environmental\ndegradation. UNDP supports LLDCs in restoring landscapes, improving resource governance,\nand promoting nature-based solutions through its Nature Pledge and partnerships with the GEF\nand GCF. From dryland restoration in Niger and Chad to climate-smart agriculture in Burkina\nFaso and forest management in Bhutan and Bolivia, UNDP helps countries integrate\nenvironmental priorities into national strategies while supporting local communities. Looking\nahead, UNDP will expand efforts in land restoration, inclusive governance, and green finance to\nhelp LLDCs transform natural resource vulnerabilities into pathways for resilience and\nsustainable development.\nHarnessing Extractives for Sustainable Development in LLDCs: Extractive industries,\n6\nespecially critical and development minerals, are central to the economies of many LLDCs,\ndriving exports, jobs, and public revenues. As global demand for transition minerals rises, UNDP\nsupports LLDCs in ensuring resource governance delivers inclusive and sustainable\ndevelopment. Through policy support, partnerships, and initiatives like the ACP-EU\nDevelopment Minerals Programme, UNDP has helped countries such as Burkina Faso, Zambia,\nand Mongolia advance local value addition, environmental safeguards, and community benefits,\nincluding artisanal and small-scale mining formalization. Aligned with the UN\nSecretary-General’s Panel on Critical Minerals and the Awaza Programme of Action, UNDP is\nscaling up its support for responsible mining, regional cooperation, and economic diversification\nto help LLDCs move up the value chain and benefit more equitably from the global energy\ntransition.\nAccess to Services in LLDCs: Persistent barriers ranging from fiscal constraints to geographic\n7\nisolation continue to limit access to essential services like health, education, and social\nprotection in LLDCs. UNDP helps countries overcome these barriers by strengthening public\nsystems and leveraging digital innovations to improve service delivery. In Zimbabwe, UNDP’s\nlong-standing partnership with the Global Fund contributed to a major turnaround in the HIV\nresponse, while in Kazakhstan, the Digital Family Card now connects millions to social benefits.\nRecognizing that service access underpins human resilience and inclusive development, UNDP’\nprioritizes modernizing systems, expanding digital infrastructure, and supporting universal\naccess to basic services especially for women, youth, and vulnerable communities in remote\nareas.\n2\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nInvesting in Human Capital and Skills in LLDCs: Building strong human capital is vital for\n8\nLLDCs to overcome structural constraints and foster inclusive, resilient economies. With average\nHDI and education outcomes lagging behind global levels, UNDP works across LLDCs to\nexpand access to quality education, strengthen vocational training, and improve\nlivelihoods—especially for youth, women, and marginalized groups. From digital and green skills\ndevelopment in Azerbaijan to entrepreneurship training in South Sudan and TVET\nmodernization in Bhutan, UNDP promotes skills that align with evolving labour markets. UNDP\nwill intensify investments in human capital to support job-rich economic diversification, expand\ndigital learning, and help LLDCs unlock the full potential of their people for long-term\ndevelopment.\nDriving Digital Transformation in LLDCs: LLDCs face deep digital divides, with only 27% of\n9\ntheir populations using the internet, compared to 90% in developed countries. UNDP is\nsupporting digital inclusion by expanding infrastructure, building skills, and designing inclusive\ndigital services. From smart health systems in Malawi to digital social protection in Kazakhstan\nand AI strategies in Mongolia, UNDP helps LLDCs harness digital technologies for better\ngovernance, service delivery, and economic opportunity. In South Sudan, digitizing community\nlending platforms reduced interest rates and expanded financial access for border communities.\nLooking ahead, UNDP will deepen its support to LLDCs in scaling connectivity, building digital\npublic infrastructure, and shaping responsible AI use, ensuring digital transformation accelerates\nnot undermines, but boosts inclusive development.\nFinancing Sustainable Development in LLDCs: Since the Addis Ababa Action Agenda,\n10\nfinancing for development has evolved rapidly, yet LLDCs still face persistent challenges—aid\ndependence, rising debt risks, and limited private capital access. Over a third are in or near debt\ndistress, and FDI remains low and narrowly focused. UNDP has played a catalytic role in\nstrengthening financial governance, diversifying finance, and aligning public and private\ninvestments with development goals. In 23 LLDCs, it has supported Integrated National\nFinancing Frameworks, advanced gender-responsive and climate finance, and promoted\ninclusive public-private dialogue. These efforts are enhancing fiscal resilience and inclusion.\nUNDP will continue helping LLDCs build sustainable, forward-looking financing systems to drive\nlong-term development.\nSustainable LDC Graduation of LLDCs: Sixteen of the world’s 32 LLDCs are also classified as\n11\nLeast Developed Countries (LDCs), facing compounded vulnerabilities from geographic\nisolation, structural economic weaknesses, and exposure to external shocks. Graduation from\nLDC status remains challenging, with only Bhutan having successfully graduated as an LLDC\n(since Botswana in 1994). UNDP supports LLDC-LDCs countries through tailored policy advice,\ncapacity building, and smooth transition strategies to help safeguard development gains\npost-graduation. In Bhutan and Nepal, UNDP has strengthened national planning,\ndecentralization, and institutional resilience to support inclusive transitions. Aligned with the\nAwaza and Doha Programmes of Action, UNDP will continue to support LLDC-LDCs in\nadvancing sustainable graduation pathways by linking national policies with global frameworks\nand building long-term resilience against shocks.\n3\nINTRODUCTION\nUNDP’s Strategic Engagement with\nLandlocked Developing Countries: A\nDecade of Impact and a Committment\nfor the Future\nThe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been a steadfast partner through the years\nto Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs), supporting their efforts to overcome structural challenges\nand achieve sustainable development under the framework of the Vienna Programme of Action (VPoA)\n2014–2024. Over the past decade, UNDP has worked closely with all 32 LLDCs to advance progress\nacross the six priority areas of the VPoA, leveraging its technical expertise, expansive network of\ncountry offices, and ability to mobilize financial resources to promote inclusive, resilient, and sustainable\ndevelopment.\nUNDP’s country offices serve as the operational backbone of UNDP's support, ensuring that global\nknowledge, financing, and technical expertise are translated into context-specific, nationally owned\nsolutions. Country offices in nations such as Zambia, Nepal, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia, Bolivia, and Armenia,\namong others, have played pivotal roles in supporting national development plans, implementing\nclimate and governance programmes, and helping governments access and manage international\nfinancing instruments. UNDP's in-country presence enables it to provide agile, responsive, and\nsustained support across diverse development and crisis contexts.\nLLDCs face deep structural constraints due to their geographical location, with no direct access to\nseaports, leading to high transport costs, logistical inefficiencies, and reduced trade competitiveness.\nThese countries represent about 7% of the global population yet account for only 1.1% of global\nmerchandise exports. Their economies remain vulnerable to external shocks, heavily dependent on\nprimary commodities, and marked by low levels of industrialization and economic diversification. The\nCOVID-19 pandemic, climate-induced disasters, and rising debt burdens have further exacerbated\nthese vulnerabilities. Several LLDCs are now classified as being in or at high risk of debt distress. At the\nsame time, Official Development Assistance (ODA) remains both insufficient and unevenly distributed —\nwith five LLDCs receiving nearly half of all ODA disbursed to the group between 2014 and 2023.\nAgainst this backdrop, UNDP has delivered targeted support across key areas, including strengthening\ngovernance, climate resilience, economic transformation, financing for development, regional\nconnectivity and trade, MSMEs, health and social protection, human capital and skills development, and\ndigital transformation. At the country level, this includes strengthening decentralized governance in\nMoldova and Nepal, advancing electoral and constitutional reform in Mali, and supporting disaster risk\nreduction and justice sector reform across the Sahel. Through global initiatives like the Integrated\nNational Financing Frameworks (INFFs), UNDP has supported 23 LLDCs to align public and private\nresources with SDG priorities, improving fiscal governance, investment frameworks, and policy\ncoherence.\nAs LLDCs transition to the next phase of their development journey under the Programme of Action for\nLLDCs for the Decade 2024–2034, UNDP remains committed to deepening its engagement. The new\n4\nINTRODUCTON\nagenda calls for action across five key pillars: transformative economic diversification and structural\nchange, enhanced regional connectivity and trade, improved governance and institutional capacities,\nresilience to climate and external shocks, and sustainable financing. These priorities are closely aligned\nwith UNDP’s, which focuses on integrated development solutions to promote human development and\nachieve prosperity for all within the planetary boundaries.\nFIGURE 1\nAWAZA Programme of Action (2024 - 2034) Key Priorities\nStructural Transformation and Science, Technology, and Innovation\n1\nAccelerating inclusive and sustainable economic diversification in LLDCs through\nindustrialization, digitalization, innovation, and technological upgrading.\nTrade, Trade Facilitation and Regional Integration\n2\nReducing trade costs, enhancing productive capacities, and strengthening LLDC\nparticipation in regional and global value chains through improved trade policies and\nregional cooperation.\nAWAZA\nTransit, Transport, and Connectivity\nProgramme 3 Improving efficient, secure, and climate-resilient transit systems, infrastructure, and\nof Action cross-border connectivity to overcome geographical constraints.\nEnhancing Adaptive Capacity, Strengthening Resilience, Reducing Vulnerability\n4\nBuilding the resilience of LLDCs to climate shocks, natural disasters, and external crises\nthrough risk-informed development and adaptation strategies.\nMeans of Implementation\n5\nMobilizing adequate, predictable, and sustainable financing, partnerships,\ncapacity-building, and data systems to support implementation of the Awaza\nProgramme of Action.\nLooking ahead, UNDP will strengthen its role as a trusted partner by scaling investments in catalytic\nareas such as:\n▪ Investing in inclusive and effective governance to foster civic trust, peace, and institutional\nresilience;\n▪ Promoting economic transformation and digitalization to unlock productivity, trade opportunities\nand inclusive value chains;\n▪ Supporting climate adaptation, energy transition, and natural resource management, while\nleveraging nature-positive solutions, especially in high-risk areas;\n▪ Capitalizing on the demographic youth dividend by investing in human capital development and\nskills for today and tomorrow; and\n▪ Boosting financing for development, including through public and private blended finance\nsolutions.\nWith over a decade of partnership, evidence-based programming, and deep presence in 31 out of the\n32 LLDCs, UNDP is well positioned to help these countries turn structural constraints into drivers of\nsustainable and inclusive development. The coming decade is an opportunity to accelerate progress,\nstrengthen resilience, and ensure that LLDCs are not only included but empowered within the global\ndevelopment architecture.\n5\n7\nINTRODUCTION\nUNDP’s technical expertise and\nfinancial resources have played a\ncritical role in advancing sustainable\ndevelopment in LLDC\nIn the past decade, UNDP invested over USD 12.5 billion across the 32 programmatic countries. In the\nearlier part of this timeframe, the Asia-Pacific region saw a high concentration of UNDP investments in\nLLDCs, largely due to significant funding directed to Afghanistan. Afghanistan's unique challenges —\nstemming from ongoing conflict, socio-economic instability, and complex humanitarian needs —\nrequired substantial UNDP support, which led to an overall Asia-Pacific investment figure of\napproximately USD 4.76 billion over the decade (Fig. 2). This figure, while reflecting a broad regional\nfocus, was heavily influenced by Afghanistan's substantial needs rather than a uniformly distributed\ninvestment across the LLDCs in the region. As the decade progressed, African LLDCs emerged as the\nprimary recipients of LLDC funding, receiving approximately USD 5.97 billion by the end of 2023. This\nreorientation not only reflects UNDP’s adaptive strategy to align resources with evolving regional needs\nbut also acknowledges the larger population share in African LLDCs, where nearly 57% of the total\nLLDC population resides. Persistent structural challenges in these countries such as infrastructure\ndeficits, trade barriers, and climate vulnerabilities require intensified support.\nFIGURE 2\nUNDP Investment in LLDCs by Region and Source of Funding (2014 - 2023)\nUN\nAgencies Other\n180 Million 67 Million\nLLDCs in LAC LLDCs in Africa\nEU\n382.2 Million 5.97 Billion\n812 Million Bilateral Donors\n4.75 Billion\nProgramme\nCountries\n816 Million\nLLDCs - Europe\nand the CIS\nMPTF and JPs\n1.55 Billion\n310 Million\nLLDCs in Asia and UNDP**\nVertical Funds\nthe Pacific 1.36 Billion\n3.64 Billion\n4.76 Billion\n* This includes Thematic Funding Windows and other sources.\n6\nINTRODUCTION\nThis allocation over the 10-year period illustrates UNDP’s commitment to addressing both immediate,\ncrisis-driven needs in countries like Afghanistan and longer-term developmental barriers in African\nLLDCs. Meanwhile, Europe and the CIS received a cumulative investment of USD 1.55 billion, and Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean (LAC) received USD 382.2 million, indicating a steady but more moderate\nlevel of support in these regions, aimed at addressing their specific, though comparatively less acute,\ndevelopmental challenges.\nThe funding distribution during the decade reveals a diverse and multi-layered support system. The\nlargest share, USD 4.75 billion, came from bilateral donors, emphasizing the crucial role of individual\ncountries (Fig. 3) in backing UNDP’s efforts in LLDCs. Vertical funds contributed the second-largest\nshare at USD 3.64 billion, indicating targeted investments that address thematic priorities such as\nclimate resilience and health. UNDP’s own resources amounted to USD 1.36 billion, underscoring its\ncommitment to these countries' development needs alongside external funding. Programme countries\nthemselves contributed USD 816 million, showing a trend toward domestic co-financing, which\nenhances the ownership and sustainability of development initiatives. The European Union, UN\nagencies, Multi-Partner Trust Funds (MPTFs), Joint Programmes, and other sources collectively\ncontributed over USD 1.3 billion, showcasing strong partnerships and collaboration within the UN\nsystem to support sustainable development in LLDCs. Together, this blend of funding sources enabled\nUNDP to pursue both targeted and holistic approaches to address the unique challenges faced by\nLLDCs.\nUNDP has allocated, on average, 34% of its regular resources to LLDCs over the past decade. Within\nthis allocation, African LLDCs have received the majority share, accounting for 76.6% of the regular\nresources directed to these countries (Fig. 4). LLDCs in Asia have received 15.5%, while those in Europe\nand the CIS have received 5.5%. LAC LLDCs received the smallest portion, with just 1% of the allocated\nresources. This distribution underscores UNDP’s focus on African LLDCs, recognizing the persistent\nand significant development challenges they face compared to LLDCs in other regions.\nFIGURE 3\nExpenditures by the top 10 Bilateral Donors 2014-2023 (hundred million USD)\n90%\n1,200\nOF BILATARAL DONOR\nINVESTMENTS IN LLDCs\n1,000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\nJAPAN USA GERMANY UNITED ITALY SWEDEN NORWAY NETHERLANDS SOUTH SWITZERLAND OTHER\nKINGDOM KOREA BILATERAL\nDONORS\n7\nINTRODUCTION\nFIGURE 4\nUNDP Investment in LLDCs by Type of Funding (2014 - 2023)*\nBOTSWANA\nBURKINA FASO\nBURUNDI\nCENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC\nCHAD\nESWATINI\nETHIOPIA\nLESOTHO\nMALAWI\nMALI\nNIGER\nRWANDA\nSOUTH SUDAN\nUGANDA\nZAMBIA\nZIMBABWE\nAFGHANISTAN\nBHUTAN\nLAO PDR\nMONGOLIA\nNEPAL\nARMENIA\nAZERBAIJAN\nKAZAKHSTAN\nKYRGYZSTAN\nMOLDOVA\nNORTH MACEDONIA\nTAJIKISTAN\nTURKMENISTAN\nUZBEKISTAN\nBOLIVIA\nPARAGUAY\n0.0 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%\nRegular resources Cost Sharing Trust Funds\n8\nsCDLL\nNACIRFA\nsCDLL\nNAISA\nsCDLL\nSIC\n&\nEPORUE\nCAL\nINTRODUCTION\nWithin the vertical funds key sources include the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria\n(GFATM), the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), and the Global Climate Fund (GCF). An overwhelming\nmajority of these funds, approximately USD 2.96 billion, come from the GFATM, underscoring the\nemphasis on health interventions in LLDCs. The GEF is the next largest contributor with USD 546 million,\nfollowed by the GCF at USD 100 million. Together, these vertical funds are structured to address critical\nareas such as health crises, environmental protection, and climate resilience, thereby supporting\nsustainable development in these high-need contexts.\nAs depicted in the funding distribution (Fig. 5), Zimbabwe is the largest recipient of vertical fund\ninvestments among LLDCs, receiving a substantial share primarily from GFATM. This high allocation\nreflects the country's significant health challenges and the need for intensive support to combat\ndiseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Following Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Sudan, Chad,\nand Burundi also received notable funding, with these countries similarly facing health, environmental,\nand climate-related challenges that vertical funds are structured to address.\nBeyond health-related funds, the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and the Global Climate Fund (GCF)\nhave also played critical roles in supporting LLDCs. These funds are primarily directed toward countries\nfacing acute environmental and climate vulnerabilities, ensuring that resources are allocated to mitigate\nclimate risks, protect biodiversity, and promote sustainable development. The distribution of funds\nacross these major recipients illustrates how vertical funds enable focused interventions, supporting\ncountries with the greatest needs within thematic areas of health and environmental sustainability. This\ntargeted approach helps address specific development gaps while complementing broader\ninvestments in LLDCs.\nFIGURE 5\nTop 10 LLDC Recipients of Vertical Funds 2013-2024 (hundred million USD)\n2,000\n85%\nOF VERTICAL FUNDS\n1,500\n1,000\n500\n0\nZIMBABWE ZAMBIA SOUTH CHAD BURUNDI AFGHANI- KAZAKH- TAJIKI- MALI BOLIVIA REMAINING\nSUDAN STAN STAN STAN LLDCs\nGlobal Fund to Fight Global Environmental Global Climate Other Global Funds\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Facility (GEF) Fund (GCF)\nMalaria (GFATM)\n9\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 1\nGovernance Systems that Deliver:\nEnhancing Institutional Capacity\nGovernance is central to sustainable development, shaping how societies make decisions, uphold the\nrule of law, and deliver essential services. When governance systems are inclusive, transparent, and\naccountable, they foster trust between people and institutions, promote stability, and enable equitable\naccess to opportunities. Conversely, weak or exclusionary governance undermines social cohesion,\ndeepens inequality, and increases the risk of conflict or instability.\nToday, several major trends are reshaping the governance landscape. First, democratic backsliding and\nshrinking civic space have emerged as pressing concerns in many contexts, with rising restrictions on\nfreedoms of expression, assembly, and association. These dynamics limit citizen participation, weaken\ninstitutional legitimacy, and threaten social contracts essential for peace and development.\nSecond, rapid digital transformation is redefining how governance operates, offering opportunities to\nimprove service delivery and transparency, but also posing challenges related to equity, privacy, and\ninstitutional capacity. Harnessing digital tools effectively requires modernizing governance frameworks\nto ensure technology benefits all segments of society and reinforces, rather than undermines,\naccountability and inclusion.\nThird, persistent corruption and weak integrity systems remain significant barriers to effective\ngovernance, diverting resources from development priorities and eroding public confidence.\nStrengthening anti-corruption mechanisms and fostering a culture of integrity are critical to building\nresilient institutions and advancing the SDGs.\nFinally, integrated, multi-level governance approaches are increasingly vital, as complex global\nchallenges like climate change, pandemics, and economic shocks demand coherent responses that\nengage actors across local, national, and international levels. Ensuring governance systems are\nresponsive, inclusive, and adaptable is essential for societies to navigate uncertainty and build shared\nprosperity.\nUNDP’s governance-related work in LLDCs is grounded in a comprehensive approach that seeks to\nstrengthen local and national institutions, promote inclusive and accountable governance, and accelerate\nprogress toward sustainable development. Recognizing the diversity of local contexts, UNDP supports a\nwide range of interventions including capacity building for elected representatives, public officials and civil\nservants, policy formulation, and institutional development. These efforts aim to enhance democratic\nparticipation and representation, improve public service delivery, and foster transparency, accountability,\nand human rights at all levels of government. UNDP’s support for decentralization and local governance\nreforms is particularly prominent, aiming to empower subnational governments to manage the\nopportunities and responsibilities arising from devolution, and to ensure governance systems are\nresponsive to the needs of marginalized and vulnerable populations. This work is closely linked to broader\ndevelopment objectives, such as building resilience to crises, fostering inclusive economic development,\npromoting gender equality, and advancing environmental sustainability, and is carried out in partnership\nwith national stakeholders and the international community.\n10\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 1\nOver the past decade, UNDP’s governance interventions in LLDCs have prioritized strengthening legal\nand institutional frameworks for decentralization; building the capacity of local governments for\nparticipatory planning, budgeting, and service delivery; enhancing transparency, accountability, and\ninclusive participation in local governance; and mainstreaming cross-cutting issues – such as gender\nequality, health (including HIV/AIDS) and social inclusion – into local planning processes.\nIn Nepal, UNDP supported the strengthening of the planning and monitoring capacity of the\nNational Planning Commission and the implementation of participatory district\ndevelopment and local governance programmes. These interventions contributed to\ndecentralization by empowering local governments to plan, implement, and monitor\ndevelopment activities, and by promoting inclusive participation in local governance\nstructures.\nIn Moldova, the Decentralization Strategy laid the groundwork for a decade of reforms\naimed at consolidating local governance. UNDP supported the implementation of this\nstrategy by promoting greater transparency, accountability, and efficiency in both central\nand local public authorities. This support included capacity development for local officials,\nfacilitation of participatory planning, and strengthening of administrative governance.\nIn Lao PDR, UNDP’s support involved advocacy for decentralization, piloting projects to\ndemonstrate the benefits of local participation, and building the capacity of local officials in\nplanning and programme development. These interventions were essential in contexts\nwhere local officials were unfamiliar with basic governance concepts such as action\nplanning and annual programming. The focus was on demonstrating that local participation\nis both feasible and beneficial for advancing human development.\nIn Burkina Faso, UNDP supports decentralization and local development across 10 of the\ncountry’s 13 regions and 114 out of 350 municipalities. These efforts benefit over 10 million\npeople by improving living conditions, expanding access to services (such as civil\nregistration and healthcare) and strengthening transparency and accountability in local\ngovernance and planning processes.\nIn Chad, from the outset to the conclusion of the transition process, UNDP played a pivotal\nrole in supporting the return to constitutional order through the establishment and\nmanagement of a basket fund dedicated to the transition. This support included embedded\nelectoral technical assistance and surge capacity to key electoral institutions, such as the\nNational Agency for the Management of Elections (ANGE) and the Constitutional Council.\nUNDP also procured electoral materials to enhance the credibility and inclusiveness of the\nprocess, and supported civic awareness and women’s empowerment through grants to\nCSOs and national campaigns. For the first time, election materials were pre-positioned two\nweeks ahead of voting. Women’s participation exceeded government quotas, and election\ncosts were reduced by over 20%. Despite these advances, concerns remain around the\ntransparency of the process.\nIn Ethiopia, UNDP’s SEEDS 2 Project (2023–2027) builds on the success of SEEDS 1 to\nstrengthen electoral systems and promote inclusive, transparent, and accountable\ndemocratic processes. It supports the National Elections Board of Ethiopia by enhancing\ninstitutional capacity, promoting inclusive participation, and improving the legal and\ninformation environment for credible elections.\n11\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 1\nIn Mali, the PROSMED programme and the Sahel Resilience Project have contributed to\nimproved access to justice, conflict prevention, and basic services across 22 districts1.\nSince 2021, PROSMED has trained nearly 2,800 formal and informal actors—including\nwomen and youth—on women’s rights and conflict management, revitalized over 320 land\ncommissions, and resolved 239 local conflicts². It also piloted legal assistance in Mopti,\nsupported gender-based violence cases, and aided the development of a national\nanti-corruption strategy³. In parallel, the programme implemented over 60 community\ninitiatives to prevent violent extremism, including training for religious leaders and students\nin six central-southern districts⁴.\nIn Armenia, the “Modern Parliament for a Modern Armenia” (MAP) project, implemented by\nUNDP Armenia in its first phase (2019–2023), significantly contributed to strengthening the\nNational Assembly’s institutional capacities, transparency, and public engagement. It\nsupported the development of e-parliament tools, modernized legislative procedures, and\nenhanced the skills of parliamentary staff and committees. Building on these results, MAP 2.0\n(2023–2026) aims to deepen reforms by advancing digital transformation, promoting gender\nequality and youth engagement, and strengthening the parliament’s responsiveness,\noversight, and connection with citizens.\nLOOKING AHEAD\nThe Awaza Programme of Action places governance as a central element of its vision for sustainable\nand resilient development in LLDCs. It recognizes effective, transparent, and accountable institutions as\nfoundational for achieving structural transformation, fostering inclusive growth, and enhancing social\ncohesion. It emphasizes that strong governance is not only essential for facilitating trade and investment\nbut also for upholding human rights, reducing inequality, and building trust between governments and\ncitizens. By framing governance as a central pillar rather than a peripheral enabler, it marks a clear\nevolution in the LLDC development agenda.\nUNDP’s strategic priorities place effective governance at the very core of its ambition to support\ncountries in navigating complex, interconnected challenges. Governance is framed not merely as a\ntechnical domain but as a foundational enabler of systemic change, echoing Awaza’s call for\naccountable and resilient institutions to underpin sustainable development in LLDCs. UNDP commits to\nsupporting public institutions at both national and local levels to enhance service delivery, foster social\ncohesion, and improve resilience to shocks. Recognizing the growing importance of digital\ntransformation, UNDP will expand support for digital public infrastructure, helping countries build more\nresponsive, transparent, and citizen-centered governance systems, with special emphasis on using AI\nand data to improve public services and policymaking.\nMore importantly, governance is strategically placed within a systems approach, integrating it across\nprosperity, environmental sustainability, and crisis resilience objectives — ensuring governance reforms\nare not siloed but contribute to broader transformations sought by Awaza and other Programmes of\nActions. UNDP will intensify its work on economic governance to make public finance more equitable\nand accountable, catalyze anti-corruption efforts, and strengthen public-private partnerships.\nFurthermore, UNDP’s investments in local governance, conflict analysis, community security, and\nparticipatory processes will help LLDCs address root causes of instability, complementing Awaza’s\nemphasis on governance as a tool for resilience in the face of crises.\n12\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 2\nFacilitating Regional Connectivity and\nTrade for LLDCs\nLLDCs disproportionately face high trade costs due to inadequate infrastructure and their lack of direct\naccess to seaports. For instance, the average distance of a landlocked country to a seaport is 1,370\nkilometres, delaying the movement of goods and services and causing higher transportation costs5.\nGiven these challenges, regional integration and trade facilitation serve as critical pathways to\nincreased economic resilience and competitiveness, inclusive growth, and sustainable development\nacross LLDCs.\nFor LLDCs, reaching international markets depend not only on their own policies and infrastructure but\nalso on those of neighboring countries, making regional integration, including the harmonization of\ninvestment frameworks essential for improving transit transport connectivity and expanding regional\nmarkets.⁶ From 2014 to 2023, LLDCs concluded at least 100 new international investment agreements\n(IIAs), including 71 bilateral investment treaties and 29 treaties with investment provisions, with at least\n58 of these new IIAs entering into force during this period.⁷ At least 14 IIAs were concluded between\nLLDCs or between LLDCs and neighboring countries.⁸ This points to a broader trend of growing\nregionalization as LLDCs seek a strategic balance between global trade integration and regional\neconomic resilience, marking a significant advancement in regional cooperation among LLDCs and\nother developing countries.\nUNDP supports LLDCs in strengthening their participation in regional trade and investment frameworks\nby providing technical assistance, policy development and planning, and capacity-building to improve\ntrade facilitation, reduce non-tariff barriers, and harmonize cross-border procedures. Through initiatives\nsuch as the Aid for Trade Programme and targeted support for the implementation of the AfCFTA, UNDP\nhas helped LLDCs align national strategies with regional commitments, enhance institutional\ncoordination, and improve infrastructure planning. This support has contributed to increased\nintra-regional trade, and expanded market access for SMEs, laying the groundwork for more inclusive\nand sustainable economic development among LLDCs and their regional trade partners.\nENHANCED INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (EIF)\nThe EIF is the only multilateral partnership dedicated to assisting LDCs in leveraging trade as an\nengine for growth, sustainable development and poverty reduction.⁹ First established in 1997 and\nhaving completed its second phase (2015 - 2024).10 EIF consists of 51 countries, 26 donors, and\neight partner agencies working closely with governments, development organizations, and civil\nsociety.11 Since its inception, EIF has invested more than USD 22012 million in\ntrade-for-development initiatives with partner countries, generating more than USD 1 billion in\nexports, and extending support to 37 countries to integrate trade into their national development\nplans.13 61% of EIF productive capacity beneficiaries are women.14\n13\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 2\nUNDP has played a key role in supporting the EIF partnership in providing technical support in\nformulating and implementing trade policies, and strengthening trade-related institutions, across\nseveral LLDCs, including Bhutan, Central African Republic, Chad, Lesotho, South Sudan and\nUganda, while also supporting capacity assessments in Burkina Faso and Malawi.\nIn South Sudan, which became the world’s youngest nation after its secession from Sudan in 2011,\nUNDP’s support under the EIF has been pivotal in strengthening trade institutions and promoting\ninclusive, trade-led development in a post-conflict setting. UNDP supported the country’s first EIF\nDiagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) and its 2022 update, integration of trade into national\ndevelopment strategies, and capacity building on economic diplomacy and regional trade.15 The\npartnership also led to the launch of South Sudan’s first e-commerce platform, Dukaanye, and a\ndedicated e-commerce hub to support MSMEs, particularly women-led enterprises. Support\nextended to WTO accession efforts, AfCFTA engagement, and market access initiatives in the\nshea butter value chain.16\nIn Lesotho, the UNDP-EIF partnership has significantly strengthened agricultural value chains and\ntrade capacity, particularly in the horticulture sector. Working with the International Trade Centre,\nthe partnership supported the development of the 2021–2025 National Trade Strategy and helped\nboost MSME exports in key sectors. Through greenhouse installations, pest surveillance, and\nprovision of hybrid seeds, vegetable production among supported farmers increased by 20%, and\nover 650 horticulture jobs were created.17 More than 100 smallholder greenhouse operators were\ntrained in business management and traceability, improving formal market access.18 The\nprogramme also enhanced Lesotho’s engagement in AfCFTA negotiations, sensitized over 120\nMSMEs across 3 districts on export procedures, and expanded training and capacity building for\njournalists on trade policies.19\nIn Bhutan, the UNDP-EIF partnership has played a significant role in advancing inclusive trade\ndevelopment aligned with the country’s unique Gross National Happiness (GNH) approach and its\nsuccessful graduation from LDC status in 2023. Since 2009, EIF has supported institutional\ncapacity-building, trade policy formulation, and human resource development through the National\nImplementation Unit (NIU), enabling effective inter-ministerial coordination and Aid for Trade (AfT)\nimplementation. Bhutan’s National Export Strategy (2022), developed with support from UNDP\nthrough the EIF, serves as a roadmap for boosting export growth by identifying key constraints and\nproposing reforms to address institutional, legal, and infrastructure gaps, improve standards and\ncertification, strengthen productive capacities, and enhance export promotion. Other key\nachievements include the development of e-governance platforms, e-commerce policy\nguidelines, and an e-regulation portal, which has attracted over USD 14.5 million in FDI and USD\n350 million of domestic investment projects since its launch in 2020.20 With support from the EIF,\nin 2017, Bhutan launched an online auction system for potatoes, among the nation’s main exports,\nto improve price transparency and reduce transaction costs21, enabling over 3,000 farmers (61% of\nthem women) to access market information, increase profits, and reduce processing time, with the\ninitiative later expanded to other commodities like cardamom.\nThe “Made in Bhutan” branding initiative and Seal of Excellence have enhanced export visibility\nand MSME participation in international markets and trade fairs. The partnership has also\nsupported the Bhutan Association of Women Enterprises, with over 4,000 members, by providing\ntraining on microfinance and financial literacy, along with fostering financial inclusion by installing\nportable ATMs across districts where communities have no access to banks.22\n14\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 2\nAID FOR TRADE IN CENTRAL ASIA\nUNDP’s Aid for Trade in Central Asia programme focuses on supporting LLDCs in Central Asia\n(Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) in pursuing inclusive and sustainable economic\ndevelopment by increasing private sector and MSME competitiveness, advancing economic\ndiversification and resilience, supporting regional trade cooperation, connectivity, and integration,\nand enhancing value addition and promoting green value chains.23 In particular, the programme\naddresses the challenges of LLDCs in Central Asia in transitioning from commodity-dependent\ngrowth to more inclusive and sustainable development by diversifying their economies,\nexpanding private sector productive capacities, fomenting regional trade integration, accessing\nnew markets, and strengthening job creation across sectors such as agriculture, food processing,\nand tourism, with a strong focus on gender equality and environmental sustainability.24\nImplemented since 2009 and currently in its fifth phase (2022 - 2025), the programme has\nsupported the development of inclusive trade development policies and support services, while\nstrengthening the economic competitiveness of MSMEs, especially during crises (such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic), enhancing firm-level efficiencies and productive capacities, increased value\naddition, and the development of green, employment-rich, and resilient value chains.25\nIn Kyrgyzstan, efforts focused on strengthening the legal framework for trade, improving digital\nexport platforms, and promoting market access for MSMEs, particularly in key sectors like tourism\nand e-commerce.26\nIn Uzbekistan, the project worked closely with national partners to refine trade regulations,\nenhance investment policies, and support women-led enterprises through mentorship and\nbusiness development initiatives.27\nIn Tajikistan, emphasis was placed on assessing and removing regulatory barriers for trade,\ndeveloping an Export Promotion Law, and modernizing trade support services to improve market\naccess.28\nAt the regional level, the initiative supported the harmonization of quality standards and improved\ninternational market access for key agricultural exports, organization of regional workshops and\ncapacity building on Free-Trade Agreements negotiations, and training over 250 trade and export\nmarketing specialists, MSME exporters, and trade support professionals in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,\nand Uzbekistan on identifying new export opportunities.29\nLOOKING AHEAD\nThe Awaza Programme of Action prioritizes trade, trade facilitation, and regional integration as critical\nlevers for sustainable development in LLDCs, emphasizing the need to simplify customs procedures,\nreduce non-tariff barriers, enhance transit connectivity and infrastructure, develop transport corridors,\nand promote digital trade. Aligned with these priorities, UNDP will reinvigorate and scale up its strategic\npartnerships with UNCTAD, UNIDO, and other development partners to deliver targeted support that\nenhances LLDCs’ trade competitiveness and connectivity. This includes deepening trade\ncapacity-building, supporting transit and infrastructure reforms, and fostering inclusive participation in\nregional and global value chains. In line with its strategic priorities, UNDP will also connect trade\nfacilitation to sustainable value chain development, local economic development, and MSME\nempowerment, supporting LLDCs in realizing more diversified, inclusive, and resilient economies.\n15\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 3\nUnlocking Local Economic Development:\nSupport to MSMEs in LLDCs\nMicro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) account for about 90% of businesses and more than 50%\nof employment worldwide.30 In developing countries, including LLDCs, this share is even higher after\naccounting for the informal sector.31 Across LLDCs, MSMEs play a critical role in enabling local economic\ndevelopment and inclusive growth, employment creation and income generation, enhancement of\ntrade and value chain beneficiation, and poverty alleviation.32 Approximately 60% of the population in\nLLDCs is under 25, representing a large source of potential and innovation.33 Yet, youth in LLDCs face\nhigh unemployment, inadequate educational and training opportunities in STEM fields, and lack\naffordable ICT access34, and many are self-employed or employed in the informal sector.35\nDespite representing the vast majority of firms in LLDCs, MSMEs frequently encounter significant\nbarriers, such as limited access to finance (characterized by high interest rates, excessive collateral\nrequirements, and underdeveloped financial systems), infrastructure deficits, regulatory and\nbureaucratic hurdles, and difficulty accessing trade finance and formal markets.36 In addition, MSMEs\noften struggle with low productivity, poor working conditions and high vulnerability to economic, political\nand environmental shocks. Women, young workers and entrepreneurs operating in the informal\neconomy are particularly vulnerable, and face additional constraints.37\nEnabling access to reliable financing instruments and digital technologies can play a vital role in\nsupporting MSMEs to overcome structural challenges and serve as engines for inclusive growth, job\ncreation, and poverty reduction in LLDCs. Enhancing MSME access to digital technologies can increase\ntransparency of markets, enabling buyers and sellers to interact and trade securely, Improve and\nformalize trade networks, provide access to reliable and cost-effective online payment platforms,\nsimplify cross-border logistics and customs procedures (especially for small businesses), and unlock\nalternative financing options through fintech innovations such as crowdfunding and AI-powered\nfinancial tools, ultimately advancing financial inclusion and competitiveness for MSMEs in LLDCs.38\nUNDP provides support to over 100 countries39, including all LLDCs, in unlocking the full potential of\nMSMEs to drive inclusive, human-centred, and resilient growth by fostering an enabling environment for\nexpanding market access, enhancing productivity, advancing entrepreneurship and innovation, and\npromoting jobs, livelihoods, and decent work. This includes several projects that support agricultural\ncapacities, trade and exports, and economic resilience, with the production, development, and\ntransformation of value chains, directly contributing to men and women’s livelihoods.40 In Mali, UNDP\nhas supported women-led mango cooperatives, which equipped women farmers the right skills to grow\nand treat their produce for export. The programme helped lead to a nearly fourfold increase in Mali's\nmango exports.41\nUNDP’s SDG Value Chains Programme provides countries with technical assistance and innovative\nmethodologies to support the development of inclusive value chains, including MSMEs, enhancing their\nintegration into regional, national, and international supply chains. Using a market-driven approach, the\nprogramme enhances the local capacities of MSMEs to overcome structural barriers, such as access to\nfinance, investments in digitalization and innovation, regulatory burdens, and broader challenges in the\n16\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 3\nenabling environment, with a strong focus on social norm transformation, gender equality, and women’s\neconomic empowerment. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the initiative focused on strengthening the\neconomic resilience of SMEs, enabling them to serve as critical sources of employment and economic\nprosperity across communities42, while becoming a strong driver of sustained economic recovery and\nrelief strategies. The SDG Value Chains Programme began in Mexico in 2008 with the Supplier\nDevelopment Methodology (SDP). Globally, the SDG Value Chains Programme now operates across 16\ncountries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia,43 including LLDCs such\nas Botswana and Paraguay. In Paraguay, the programme has demonstrated transformative impact\nthrough the En Marcha pilot in Concepción in 2024, which strengthened core business management\ncapacities of MSMEs, more than half were women-led, leading to an increase in average monthly sales,\nimproved profitability, and advanced gender-responsive business strategies.44\nIn Botswana, the SDP strengthened the resilience of women and youth-owned MSMEs during the\nCOVID-19 crisis by strengthening their productive capacity and connecting them to large national buyers\nin key sectors like agriculture, health, and technology.45 Through close mentorship, access to finance,\nand strategic partnerships — including with First National Bank Botswana, the SDP empowered SMEs to\nimprove quality, increase revenues, and build long-term resilience in a challenging, resource-dependent\neconomy. Through a partnership with the Ministry of Youth, Sports and Culture and the Botswana\nInnovation Hub, UNDP is rolling out the #YouthConnekt platform to support youth entrepreneurs with\ntailored training and mentorship, while reaching young people through digital engagement, market\nlinkages, and access to finance and networks.46\nLaunched in 2014 under UNDP Malawi’s Private Sector Development programme, the Malawi\nInnovation Challenge Fund (MICF) has mobilized catalytic grant financing and technical assistance to\nsupport economic diversification, job creation and income generation, enhanced productivity, and\ninnovation across the private sector and MSMEs, especially to increase the inclusiveness and\ncompetitiveness of value chains in crucial sectors, such as agriculture, manufacturing,47 and tourism.48\nThe programme accepts applications from MSMEs, small businesses, and the private sector in Malawi\nand matches their funding to scale inclusive business models. As of 2022, over 9 thematic rounds were\nlaunched, with USD 32 million of investments in the programme, and 56 MSMEs and private sector\ncompanies contracted to develop inclusive business models, while supporting livelihoods and income\ngeneration opportunities for nearly 600,000 individuals across more than 55,000 households, and\nsecuring permanent employment for more than 2,400 unskilled and low-income workers.49 Over 7,200\nMSMEs have accessed loans and improved financial services through the disbursement of MK 2.3 billion\nof SME loans through MICF.50 Through innovation, MICF projects have launched new or enhanced\nproducts that have brought access to basic services for low-income consumers.51 Over 40% of MICF’s\nbeneficiaries are women, and 27% of MICF projects are led by female owners and managers of MSMEs\nand businesses in Malawi’s private sector.52\nCOUNTRY EXAMPLE: AFGHANISTAN\nUNDP’s integrated support has provided a lifeline to 8 million women across Afghanistan,\nextending access to basic services and infrastructure, creating jobs, supporting MSMEs)\nstrengthening community resilience against hazards and climate risks, expanding access to\nrenewable energy, and providing livelihood support to farmers. In addition to fostering social\ncohesion and solidarity in the workplace, UNDP’s integrated approach also includes the\ndevelopment of digital skills, to empower women to overcome mobility restrictions and effectively\nmarket their products. The provision of solar power to MSMEs employing women, reduces\nreliance on expensive, polluting generators, reducing emissions and cutting operational costs.53\n17\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 3\nThe resulting savings are then reinvested to expand capacity and create more employment for\nwomen. For example, in 2024, a seed investment of US $4 million from UNDP’s core resources\nunlocked over US $34 million of non-core funding to advance women’s socio-economic\nempowerment in Afghanistan. These investments supported almost 80,000 female-led MSMEs\nnationwide, and have generated nearly 400,000 jobs, mostly for women, and have indirectly\nbenefited over 2.7 million Afghan citizens. Despite harsh restrictions, community savings and loan\ngroups have further supported over 27,000 women in starting and expanding their businesses,\nenhancing the economic resilience of their communities.54 By expanding access to financial\ninclusion, women have also contributed to their families, creating a chain of prosperity that\nrevitalizes communities and can potentially improve the lives of generations to come. A\npreliminary assessment of the programme, in 2024, provides evidence of positive impact, with an\noverall boost in production and a 100 percent increase in income for surveyed women, who\nbenefited from the integrated interventions.55\nSince 2022, UNDP’s partnership with the European Union has fostered inclusive economic\nrecovery and resilience in Afghanistan, particularly through sustained support to women-led\nMSMEs, focusing on protecting community-based livelihoods, expanding access to finance, and\nstrengthening women’s role in the local economy.56\nLOOKING AHEAD\nUNDP will continue to accelerate human development by advancing its support to MSMEs and inclusive\nvalue chains across LLDCs, based on its approach to creating prosperity for all by expanding\nopportunities for MSMEs to access productive assets, decent jobs and livelihoods, and build human\ncapital, while strengthening socio-economic resilience against shocks, crises, and multidimensional\nvulnerabilities. This entails equipping MSMEs with financing, skills, knowledge, and technologies to\ncultivate entrepreneurial ecosystems through business incubation and supportive policy frameworks,\nsuch as trade policies that connect local producers to regional and global value chains. It also includes\nexpanding access to affordable credit, digital financial services, income generation, and asset-building\nopportunities, particularly for women, youth, and vulnerable communities. By facilitating decent job\ncreation, improving financial inclusion, linking local producers to national and global value chains, and\ndeepening partnerships with the private sector and civil society to unlock innovation, capital, and\nexpertise, UNDP will continue working closely with governments and development partners across\nLLDCs to build inclusive and resilient economies that leave no one behind.\n18\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 4\nBuilding Climate Resilience and Advancing\nEnergy Transitions in LLDCs\nLLDCs face innumerous challenges, including infrastructure and energy access deficiencies,\ninadequate maintenance, losses from disasters, and significant vulnerabilities to accelerating climate\nand environmental impacts. Regarding energy access, a staggering 215 million people live with limited\nor no electricity in LLDCs.57\nDisparities between electricity access across LLDCs prevail. While 15 LLDCs have achieved electricity\naccess rates above 90% as of 2023, 12 LLDCs still had access rates below 60%, all of which are in\nSub-Saharan Africa.58 More so, a significant imbalance remains between urban and rural population\ngroups in LLDCs, with 86% and 62% having access to electricity in 2023, respectively. Meanwhile, the\nglobal urban average was at 98% in 2023 and the rural average was 84%, significantly higher in\ncomparison to the average energy access rate for LLDCs.59\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n19\nnatsinemkruT najiabrezA ainemrA avodloM natshkazaK aiviloB natuhB natsikijaT ainodecaM\nhtroN\negarevA\nlabolG\nCDLL\nnatsikebzU cilbupeR\nzygryK\negarevA\ndlroW\nyaugaraP anawstoB ailognoM initawsE ohtoseL lapeN natsinahgfA ewbabmiZ osaF\nanikruB\nRDP\noaL\ndahC aibmaZ aipoihtE adnawR regiN iwalaM ilaM cilbupeR\nnacirfA\nlartneC\nadnagU idniruB naduS\nhtuoS\nFIGURE 6\nShare of Population with Access to Electricity by LLDC in 2023\nUrban\nRural\nNational Average\nSource: World Bank Open Data (2023)\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 4\nThe share of LLDCs’ overall population with access to clean cooking fuel increased from 40% in 2012 to\n45% in 2022.60 There is a significant access deficit in rural areas, which have a 35% access rate,\ncompared with 61% in urban areas in 2022.61 Women are disproportionately impacted by energy poverty\nin the LLDCs, more so due to domestic reliance on charcoal and wood, and their associated health\nimplications.62\nBetween 2016 to 2025, renewable energy capacity has grown at an annual rate of less than 10% in\ndeveloping countries, and within this subset, LLDCs recorded a much lower growth rate of only 2.4%.63\nWith such annual growth rates and without further interventions, LLDCs are likely to take more than 38\nyears to achieve the renewables deployment rate similar to the average level across developing\ncountries in 2022.64\nUnder the Climate Promise Initiative, UNDP is delivering the UN system’s largest portfolio of support on\nclimate action in more than 140 countries and territories.65 This portfolio is worth over US$2 billion in\ngrant financing and also builds on UNDP’s expertise on gender equality and inclusion, energy, poverty,\nhealth, climate security, nature and biodiversity, among others.66 Since 2019, UNDP’s Climate Promise\nsupports developing countries in strengthening their climate action by setting and implementing more\nambitious goals to reduce emissions (especially through enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions\n(NDCs) under the Paris Agreement), bolstering climate resilience, and mobilizing financing. Through five\nkey pillars of adaptation, mitigation, carbon markets, forests, and policy, UNDP is supporting countries in\ndesigning and implementing bold climate actions aligned with national development goals, including\nNDCs, adaptation plans, long-term strategies, and green recovery initiatives.\nUNDP Climate Promise’s portfolio of 140 countries and territories includes support to 31 landlocked\ncountries, namely 5 countries in Asia Pacific (Afghanistan, Bhutan, Lao PDR, Mongolia, and Nepal), 8 in\nEurope and Central Asia (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, North Macedonia,\nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan), 16 in Africa (Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Central\nAfricanRepublic, Chad, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda,\nZambia, and Zimbabwe), and 2 in Latin America and the Caribbean region (Bolivia and Paraguay).67\nAmong its flagship initiatives, the Africa Minigrids Program (AMP) enhances clean energy access across\n21 countries, including 9 LLDCs (Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Malawi, Chad, Mali, Niger, Zambia, and\nBurundi) by promoting sustainable, scalable solar minigrid investments.68 AMP is a USD 50 million\ncountry-led technical assistance programme, funded by Global Environment Facility (GEF) and\nimplemented by UNDP in partnership with RMI (founded as Rocky Mountain Institute) and the African\nDevelopment Bank (AfDB).69 Renewable energy minigrids, and in particular solar-battery minigrids, offer\ngreat potential to address the 733 million people globally who currently don’t have access to electricity\n– including 567 million, or three quarters of the world’s unelectrified population, in sub-Saharan Africa.70\nIn this regard, the program aims to electrify 265 million people across its portfolio of 21 countries by\n2030.71\nIn addition, in May 2023, the Government of Japan provided72 funding to respond to the growing\ndemand of developing countries supported by UNDP to take climate action and deliver on national\nclimate pledges (also known as NDCs). This includes provision of assistance to 16 countries73 across\nAsia-Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Africa, and Arab State regions through UNDP’s Climate Promise\ninitiative, including seven landlocked countries: Armenia, Bhutan, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Malawi,\nNepal, and Serbia. The partnership has enabled UNDP to advance clean energy solutions and ambitious\nclimate action policies across regions.\n20\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 4\nPARAGUAY’S ENERGY TRANSITION: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES\nParaguay stands out globally for its nearly 100% renewable electricity supply, sourced almost\nentirely from hydropower. While this offers a clean energy advantage, the overdependence on a\nsingle source of energy presents structural risks — particularly as climate change affects water\navailability and electricity demand continues to rise. Simultaneously, the transport and industrial\nsectors remain reliant on imported fossil fuels, limiting the country’s energy autonomy and\nsustainability.\nUNDP, in collaboration with national institutions and international partners, supported the design of\na transformative project to accelerate electric mobility and public transport modernization in the\nAsunción Metropolitan Area. The project aimed to mobilize over USD 20 million in climate finance\nto unlock more than USD 150 million in total investment — enabling the deployment of 300 electric\nbuses. This initiative combined public and private funding through innovative financial instruments,\nstructured with strong commitments from multilateral banks and development agencies. The\nproject has completed its technical design phase and is currently in advanced negotiations with\ninternational investors, including green funds, sovereign wealth funds, and multilateral\ndevelopment banks. It stands as a clear example of how targeted technical assistance and\ninternational climate finance can be leveraged to unlock large-scale investment and drive systemic\ntransformation in the transport and energy sectors.\nLOOKING AHEAD\nLooking ahead, UNDP remains committed to supporting LLDCs in overcoming energy poverty and\nbuilding climate-resilient, low-carbon futures. The Awaza Programme of Action75 emphasizes protecting\npeople’s livelihoods and avoiding disruptions to trade and transport through strengthened resilience in\nLLDCs against accelerating climate impacts by rapidly scaling up climate finance and infrastructure\ninvestments to support both mitigation and adaptation efforts, incorporating disaster risk reduction\nstrategies into all development policies and strengthening early warning systems, and promoting\nbiodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources, especially given LLDCs’\nincreasing exposure to land degradation and biodiversity loss. These priorities are fully aligned with\nUNDP’s priorities, which emphasize systemic, scalable change through key levers such as nature-based\nsolutions, sustainable energy transitions, climate adaptation and resilience, circular economy\napproaches, and the integrated management of land, forests, and water systems, critical for advancing\nsustainable development and climate action in LLDCs.\nGuided by these priorities, UNDP will continue to scale up support in key areas such as sustainable\nenergy transitions, energy diversification, and strengthening energy security, particularly in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica where the access gap is most acute. In parallel, climate adaptation will remain central, with\nincreased investments in nature-based solutions (NbS) and integrated approaches that link energy\naccess with community resilience and gender equality. Across country and regional contexts, UNDP will\ndeepen its technical, policy, and financial assistance to LLDCs to ensure no country, place, or community\nis left behind in the global energy and climate transition.\n21\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 5\nManaging Natural Resources for a\nSustainable Future in LLDCs\nLandlocked Developing Countries face a distinctive set of structural constraints that severely affect their\nability to sustainably manage natural resources. With no direct access to coastlines, LLDCs depend\nheavily on agriculture, mining, and forestry – sectors that are not only vulnerable to environmental\ndegradation but also highly sensitive to global market fluctuations.\nOver half the land in LLDCs consists of drylands, which are increasingly under stress due to\ndesertification, poor land management, and climate change. This geographical reality exacerbates food\ninsecurity, limits water availability, and accelerates land degradation – making the sustainable\nmanagement of natural assets both a development necessity and a resilience imperative.\nThe implications are stark: many LLDCs rely on land-based livelihoods, yet they struggle to maintain the\necological integrity of their landscapes. Resource degradation directly undermines food systems and\neconomic productivity. With rising temperatures, erratic rainfall patterns, and increasing demand for\nfinite water and soil resources, these countries face an urgent need to adapt. In LLDCs such as Burkina\nFaso, Mali, and Ethiopia, climate shocks (especially droughts and floods) frequently devastate already\nfragile ecosystems, deepen poverty, and trigger migration. Without sustainable natural resource\ngovernance, LLDCs remain vulnerable to a vicious cycle of environmental decline and socio-economic\ninstability.\nUNDP’s Strategic Response and Nature Pledge\nRecognizing the critical nexus between environment, development, and resilience, UNDP has\nembedded nature-positive development across its portfolio. Through its Nature Pledge, UNDP has\ncommitted to help more than 140 countries implement biodiversity and ecosystem-focused solutions\nby 2030. For LLDCs, this commitment translates into concrete support for restoring degraded\nlandscapes, strengthening natural resource governance, and unlocking nature-based economic\nopportunities. UNDP’s strategic priorities position nature and climate as one of four core areas of\nintegrated development, emphasizing the link between biodiversity, climate resilience, and\nsustainable livelihoods.\nThrough the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Green Climate Fund (GCF), and its own financing\nmechanisms, UNDP has supported LLDCs in mainstreaming ecosystem management into national\ndevelopment strategies, enhancing community-based natural resource governance, and improving\naccess to sustainable land and water use technologies. Examples include climate-resilient\nagroforestry projects in Lesotho, water resource management in Tajikistan, and dryland restoration\nefforts in Niger and Chad. These interventions not only aim to preserve biodiversity but also enhance\nfood security and economic resilience, especially for rural populations living in dryland zones.\n22\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 5\nCountry-Level Impact: Tailored, Transformative Interventions\nAt the country level, UNDP’s support reflects a deep commitment to building local capacity and ensuring\ninclusive benefits. In Bolivia, a country highly dependent on extractive resources and prone to\nenvironmental degradation, UNDP has worked with indigenous communities to promote sustainable\nforest management and integrate environmental governance into subnational planning. In Mongolia,\nUNDP has facilitated partnerships that promote ecosystem-based adaptation in rangelands, which are\ncritical for pastoralist communities vulnerable to desertification.\nIn Bhutan, which is both landlocked and environmentally vulnerable despite being carbon-negative,\nUNDP has supported sustainable forest and watershed management as part of the country's graduation\nstrategy from LDC status. In Burkina Faso, UNDP has enabled communities to adopt climate-smart\nagriculture practices, enhancing soil fertility and reversing land degradation in critical dryland zones.\nOverall, UNDP’s country programming in the Sahel has increasingly focused on integrating\npeacebuilding and natural resource management to address root causes of displacement and\ninsecurity.\nLOOKING AHEAD\nAs LLDCs align with the new 2024–2034 Programme of Action, the centrality of sustainable natural\nresource management becomes even more pronounced. The new agenda calls for integrated\napproaches to land restoration, sustainable agriculture, and climate adaptation, especially across\ndrylands and arid zones that are home to the majority of LLDC populations. These approaches must be\ngrounded in inclusive governance and gender-responsive planning to ensure broad-based benefits\nand long-term sustainability.\nLooking ahead, UNDP will scale up support in four key areas: (1) Restoration and protection of drylands\nand fragile ecosystems using nature-based solutions; (2) Policy and institutional support for transparent\nand participatory natural resource governance; (3) Integration of environmental priorities into national\nSDG and climate strategies through tools like INFFs and NDCs; and (4) Mobilization of blended finance\nand private sector investment in sustainable land and resource management. These efforts will be\nunderpinned by a digital and data-driven approach to track ecosystem health and resource use\nefficiency.\nIn an era marked by climate uncertainty and geopolitical complexity, LLDCs have the potential to lead\nmodels of sustainable land use, climate adaptation, and community-based resource management. With\nits track record, in-country presence, and partnerships, UNDP remains a trusted development partner,\nready to help LLDCs transform environmental vulnerabilities into engines of resilience and inclusive\nprosperity.\n23\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 6\nHarnessing Extractives for Sustainable\nDevelopment in LLDCs\nExtractive industries, particularly the mining and processing of critical minerals, are integral to the\neconomies of LLDCs, representing a significant share of their GDP and labour force. Mineral-rich LLDCs\n(such as Mali, Burkina Faso, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Mongolia) have some of the\nhighest share of mining as a proportion of their total exports globally. Constrained by their lack of direct\naccess to maritime trade routes, several LLDCs rely on their abundant mineral resources to drive\neconomic growth, boost export industries, attract foreign investment, generate employment, and\nstrengthen public finances.76 Critical energy transition minerals, such as copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt,\nand rare earth elements, are indispensable to the transition to clean energy technologies (ranging from\nwind turbines and solar panels to electric vehicles and battery storage)77 powering the shift from fossil\nfuels to renewables, with global demand projected to nearly triple by 2030.78 In fact, the production of\ncertain minerals, such as graphite, lithium and cobalt, could increase by nearly 500% by 2050, to meet\nthe growing demand for clean energy technologies,79 promising opportunities for economic growth, job\ncreation, poverty reduction, and local development for mineral-rich LLDCs.\nNevertheless, realizing these benefits depends on effective governance. As mineral extraction\naccelerates to bridge the needs of the energy transition, it is crucial to ensure that the countries and\nlocal communities endowed with these resources are the ones to benefit the most, accelerating\ninclusive growth that leaves no one and no place behind.80 Without proper management, the increasing\ndemand for critical minerals risks perpetuating commodity dependence, exacerbating geopolitical\ntensions and environmental and social challenges, including impacts on livelihoods, the environment,\nhealth, human security and human rights, and can undermine efforts towards the energy transition.81\nFurthermore, evidence suggests that moving from raw mineral extraction to manufacturing battery\npacks and EVs, each step downstream in the production process results in a corresponding increase in\nthe economic and traded value-added of the products in the supply chain.82\nMany mineral-rich LLDCs risk being locked in the initial stages of low value-added raw material\nextraction activities, forgoing broader economic development opportunities such as industrialization,\nexport diversification, and increased value addition from subsequent stages in the critical minerals\nproduction and supply chains.\nIn April 2024, the UN Secretary-General (SG) launched the Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals\nto foster trust among governments, communities, and industry by developing voluntary principles that\nsupport a just and equitable energy transition, promote local value addition and inclusive economic\nbenefits from mineral resources, and enhance international cooperation through aligned standards and\nmultilateral action.83 In September 2024, the Panel published its report “Resourcing the energy\ntransition”, outlining seven Guiding Principles and five Actionable Recommendations, as depicted in the\nFigure below.84\n24\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 6\nFIGURE 7\nA UN framework guiding responsible and equitable mineral value chains for the energy transition.\nGUIDING PRINCIPLES ON CRITICAL ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS\nENERGY TRANSITION MINERALS\nTo embed and maintain these Guiding Principles\nacross critical energy transition mineral\nThe United Nations Secretary General’s Panel\nvalue chains, the Panel has made a number of\non Critical Energy Transition Minerals proposes\nactionable recommendations that leverage the\nseven voluntary Guiding Principles, building\nUnited Nations in the creation of key bodies and\non existing norms, commitments and legal\nprocesses.

Available at: https://www.unep.org/re-\nsources/report/resourcing-energy-transition\n25\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 6\nUNDP provides strategic and technical support across mineral-rich LLDCs in facilitating\nmulti-stakeholder partnerships, regional cooperation, negotiations and agreements, knowledge\nexchange, resource mobilization and access to financing, strengthening of governance processes, due\ndiligence and impact assessments, creation of guidelines, tools, and best practices, and the\nestablishment of policy and regulatory frameworks to ensure that mining and the extraction of critical\nminerals are inextricably linked to inclusive growth, sustainable development, and a just energy\ntransition that leaves no one behind.\nIn collaboration with UNCTAD, UNEP, and UN Regional Economic Commissions, UNDP is leading the\noperationalization of the Guiding Principles and Actionable Recommendations of the SG Panel’s report,\nthrough the UN Working Group on Transforming the Extractive Industries for Sustainable Development.\nFurthermore, UNDP has provided special attention to Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM)85,\nsupporting initiatives that promote formalization, improve health and safety standards, enhance\nenvironmental sustainability, and ensure that local communities, especially women, youth, ASM workers,\nand marginalized groups, can benefit from inclusive mineral resource development.\nFLAGSHIP INITIATIVE: ACP-EU DEVELOPMENT MINERALS PROGRAMME\nTo improve mining conditions, local economic development, and lower mercury pollution, with\nover €30 million of support from the EU since 2015, UNDP has implemented three phases of the\nACP-EU development minerals programme, which provides institutional support to the African\nUnion’s African Minerals Development Centre in improving the livelihoods and inclusion of\nartisanal and small-scale miners.86 The programme operates in multiple LLDCs, including Uganda,\nBurkina Faso, and Zambia. ACP-EU has supported ASM mining in these countries, creating jobs,\nincreasing income, and placing environmental and social safeguards. Support has included\ntraining on health, safety, and sustainable mining practices, as well as professionalizing\nsmall-scale mining cooperatives and enterprises.87 Overall, the programme has led to strong\nsupport of ASMEs and the artisanal mining sector, which has improved the wellbeing of miners,\nand more sustainable and safe mining practices being implemented. The impact of this\nprogramme is especially strong in areas dependent on mining, such as the Kassanda District in\ncentral Uganda.\nCOUNTRY EXAMPLE: MONGOLIA\nMining and critical minerals are pivotal to Mongolia’s economy, accounting for roughly 27% of GDP,88\nclearly underpinning national income, investment, and livelihoods, while accounting for 71% of\nMongolia’s industrial sector, 77% of foreign direct investment (FDI), and 92% of Mongolia’s exports.89\nMongolia is heavily dependent on coal, underpinning nearly 86% of its total electricity generation\nand 68% of its total energy supply90, exposing the country to significant economic and\nenvironmental vulnerabilities. Along with economic vulnerabilities, such as price fluctuations and\nthe global transition to clean energy, resulting from overdependence on coal, Mongolia is also\nexposed to major negative public health and environmental hazards of mining, coal production,\nand coal-power generation, including severe air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, which causes over 7,100\nannual deaths annually, and economic losses reaching 10% of Mongolia’s GDP.91 80% of the air\npollution in Ulaanbaatar is caused by the use of coal stoves.92\n26\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 2\nUNDP is leading a UN joint programme, funded by the Joint SDG Fund, to accelerate Mongolia’s\ntransition to green and renewable energy. The project involves creating a national framework for\nenergy transition, developing a climate financing framework, and ensuring a safe and healthy\nenvironment, especially for vulnerable populations93. The project not only solved environmental\nissues, but also presented new opportunities for growth, resilience, and equity, including the\ndevelopment of the renewable energy sector, important for generating economic growth and\nfighting poverty.94 This project has contributed to pollution levels in Ulaanbaatar steadily\ndecreasing in the last decade.95 However, there is still more work to be done to quicken the\ntransition towards renewable energy.\nLOOKING AHEAD\nUNDP remains committed to supporting mineral-rich LLDCs over the next decade in harnessing their\nextractive industries and critical minerals in alignment with the priorities of the Awaza Programme of\nAction (APoA) for LLDCs (2024–2034). In line with the UN SG Panel report’s seven Guiding Principles\nand five Actionable Recommendations and APoA’s emphasis on productive capacity, structural\ntransformation, and resilient infrastructure,96 UNDP will also scale efforts to support artisanal and\nsmall-scale mining, while ensuring environmental and social safeguards are mainstreamed across\nmining value chains. As global demand for transition minerals surges, UNDP will continue to support\ncapacity building, facilitate regional and transit cooperation, and strengthen institutions to help\nmineral-rich LLDCs advance value addition, jobs and livelihoods, local beneficiation, and responsible\ninvestment frameworks, while transforming their extractive dependency towards inclusive, diversified,\nand climate-resilient economies.\n27\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 7\nAccess to Services in LLDCs: A\nCornerstone for Human Development\nAccess to basic services such as health care, education, social protection, clean energy, and safe water\nis foundational to human well-being and a necessary precondition for inclusive and sustainable\ndevelopment. Yet, for many LLDCs, persistent barriers rooted in geographic isolation, structural\nvulnerabilities, and limited fiscal space have made the delivery of such services a continuing challenge.\nBeing landlocked often translates into higher transportation costs and logistical hurdles, which can\ndelay or constrain the flow of essential supplies. At the same time, many LLDCs grapple with narrow\neconomic bases, limited institutional capacity, and high levels of informality, which make service\ndelivery at scale a challenge. Fiscal constraints, exacerbated by modest domestic revenues and\nsignificant debt servicing obligations, further limit the ability of governments to invest in expanding or\nimproving essential services. These deficits not only hinder progress on the SDGs, but also deepen\npoverty, exacerbate inequality, and leave large segments of the population, particularly women, youth,\nand rural communities, without the support they need to thrive.\nAmong the most critical services are health and social protection, which serve as fundamental enablers\nof resilience, productivity, and economic participation. Health systems in LLDCs are often underfunded,\noverburdened, and geographically uneven, while social protection systems tend to have limited\ncoverage, fragmented delivery mechanisms, and weak responsiveness in times of crisis.\nHealth Systems Under Pressure\nLLDCs are home to some of the world’s most vulnerable populations, with 16 of them also classified as\nLDCs. Public health outcomes in these countries continue to lag behind global averages. Health\nexpenditure as a percentage of GDP varies widely, from 1.87% in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic\n(PDR) to 11.38% in Malawi, yet the average for LLDCs remains at just 6.12%, well below the global average\nof 9.94%97. This low level of investment constrains service delivery and limits progress in improving life\nexpectancy, which has increased at a slower pace in LLDCs compared to neighbouring and similarly\nsituated countries.\nHistorical trends further underscore these challenges. For example, several countries, including\nBotswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, suffered dramatic declines in life expectancy\nduring the HIV/AIDS epidemic between 1985 and the early 2000s, with long-term socio-economic\nconsequences. While life expectancy has since improved in many cases, vulnerabilities remain acute.\nCompounding health-related challenges is the high prevalence of undernourishment and food\ninsecurity. As of 2016, 23.2% of the population in LLDCs was undernourished, and over half (51.6%)\nexperienced food insecurity — figures that have likely worsened with the impacts of climate change and\nrecent global food price shocks. Lack of access to electricity — affecting roughly 40% of the population\n— further hampers the functioning of health facilities and limits the reach of essential services.\n28\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 7\nSocial Protection: Expanding the Safety Net\nSocial protection systems in LLDCs are often nascent, fragmented, or heavily donor-dependent. Informality\ndominates labour markets, with limited access to contributory schemes such as pensions or unemployment\ninsurance. In many LLDCs, safety nets do not adequately reach the poorest and most vulnerable, leaving\nlarge gaps in coverage and deepening exclusion. The proportion of people covered by at least one social\nprotection benefit in 2023 was significantly lower in LLDCs, with 27.6% compared to the global average of\n52.4%.98\nUNDP supports countries in building inclusive, adaptive, and sustainable social protection systems as a\ncore pillar of human development and resilience. In the context of LLDCs, where structural vulnerabilities,\ngeographic isolation, and exposure to external shocks often exacerbate poverty and exclusion, UNDP’s\napproach emphasizes integrated and nationally owned systems that can progressively expand coverage,\nreduce fragmentation, and respond to life-cycle risks. UNDP works to strengthen the design and financing\nof social protection, improve coordination across ministries and levels of government, and align social\nprotection strategies with broader development goals, such as employment generation, gender equality,\nand climate resilience. In many LLDCs, this includes linking cash transfer programmes with livelihoods, skills,\nand access to services, while also embedding social protection within longer-term planning and crisis\nresponse frameworks.\nDigital technologies offer a promising pathway for expanding coverage and improving efficiency. However,\ndigital divides — both in connectivity and in digital literacy—pose challenges that require sustained policy\nand financial investment. There is also a critical need to strengthen data systems to ensure better\nidentification of needs, targeting services, and monitoring of outcomes.\nUNDP’s Contribution\nUNDP works across LLDCs to improve access to services through integrated, context-specific approaches\nthat address both supply and demand side barriers. This includes strengthening public health systems,\nimproving the reach and efficiency of social protection programmes, and leveraging digital technologies to\nconnect vulnerable groups with the services they need.\nCOUNTRY CASE: TURNING THE TIDE ON HIV IN ZIMBABWE\nAt the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis in 2000, Zimbabwe faced one of the highest infection rates in the\nworld, with over 25% of the population living with HIV99, and AIDS-related deaths exceeding 130,000\nannually.100 The epidemic threatened the country’s human capital, food security, and economic\nstability.101 In response, UNDP partnered with the Global Fund in 2009 to launch a large-scale,\nsustained intervention. Over the past decade, more than USD 1 billion was invested in prevention,\ntesting, and treatment. By 2023, 1.2 million people were on life-saving antiretroviral therapy, and\nZimbabwe had achieved the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets three years ahead of the 2025 milestone.102\nNew infections fell to 75%, including a 70% reduction among adolescent girls and young women.103\nUNDP’s support extended beyond treatment to strengthening Zimbabwe’s health system—retaining\n27,000 health workers in 2024, supporting village health workers in remote areas, opening a medical\nwarehouse in Masvingo to expand storage and improve distribution, and equipping over 1,000 health\nfacilities with solar power. They now serve 65% of health facilities nationwide, avoiding over 16,000\ntons of CO₂ emissions annually. Today, Zimbabwe is on track to end AIDS by 2030104. It is a powerful\nexample of how sustained investment, strong partnerships, and health system innovation can deliver\na foundation for recovery and resilience.\n29\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 7\nCOUNTRY CASE: DIGITAL SOCIAL PROTECTION CARDS IN KAZAKHSTAN\nIn Kazakhstan, more than 980,000 families previously lacked official income records, social\nprotection, or regular access to Government services leaving over 3 million people without a social\nsafety net. In response, UNDP supported the Government of Kazakhstan in developing and\nimplementing the Digital Family Card, a transformative digital platform that enables real-time\nidentification of vulnerable families and streamlines access to services.\nLaunched in 2022, the platform now covers all 5.9 million families in the country and has facilitated\nthe delivery of more than 2.2 million social services. Its companion mobile application serves as a\nsingle point of contact between citizens and government institutions, simplifying benefit\napplications and improving inclusion. This digital innovation has been central to modernizing\nKazakhstan’s social protection system and ensuring that vulnerable populations are not left behind\nin the country’s development trajectory.\nLOOKING AHEAD\nWhile the Programme of Action for LLDCs for the Decade 2024–2034 does not feature access to services\nas a standalone priority, it underscores their importance within broader commitments to\nresilience-building, structural transformation, and inclusive development. The Programme highlights the\nneed to strengthen human capital and risk-informed systems, recognizing that limited access to health\ncare and social protection increases the vulnerability of LLDC populations to shocks such as pandemics,\nclimate-related disasters, and economic downturns. It calls for enhanced international cooperation to\nsupport the expansion of social protection systems, particularly in contexts where constrained fiscal space\nhampers domestic capacity to scale up safety nets. Investments in resilient infrastructure, digital public\nservices, and basic human development are presented as essential to ensuring that no one is left behind\n— especially in remote and underserved areas of LLDCs.\nIn direct response to the priorities articulated in the Programme of Action for LLDCs for the Decade\n2024–2034, UNDP will continue to place strong emphasis on expanding equitable access to essential\nservices, particularly health and social protection, as a foundation for inclusive development,\nresilience-building, and structural transformation. Recognizing the heightened vulnerability of LLDC\npopulations to shocks such as pandemics, climate-related disasters, and economic downturns, UNDP will\nsupport countries in modernizing social protection systems to be more adaptive, inclusive, and fiscally\nsustainable. This will include leveraging digital public infrastructure — such as interoperable ID systems\nand digital payment platforms — to improve transparency, efficiency, and reach of service delivery,\nespecially in remote and underserved regions.\nUNDP will also continue to strengthen national health systems and pandemic preparedness through\npartnerships with WHO, UNICEF, the Global Fund, and other actors. In contexts where constrained fiscal\nspace limits domestic capacity, UNDP will help countries access innovative financing solutions and\ndevelop integrated national planning and financing frameworks to align resources with human\ndevelopment goals. UNDP will work to enhance institutional capabilities at national and subnational levels\nto ensure the delivery of responsive, rights-based services, and will uphold its commitment to crisis\nresilience by helping to maintain continuity of essential services in fragile and conflict-affected LLDCs.\n30\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 8\nInvesting in People: Human Capital and\nSkills Development in LLDCs\nInvesting in human capital is critical for LLDCs to overcome the challenges they face, particularly their\nlimited connectivity and narrow economic bases. Strengthening education, health, nutrition, and social\nprotection systems equips people with the skills, resilience, and well-being needed to drive economic\ndiversification, reduce poverty, and enhance social cohesion. Human capital development also enables\nLLDCs to better harness opportunities in regional and global markets by improving productivity and\nfostering innovation. Yet, as highlighted by the 2025 UNDP Human Development Report (HDR), global\nprogress on human development has slowed dramatically, marking the weakest growth since 1990\noutside of crisis years. LLDCs, particularly those that are also LDCs have fallen further behind, with many\nnot yet recovering to pre-pandemic benchmarks, underscoring the urgency of accelerating investments\nin human capital to avoid widening inequalities. The HDR argues that without targeted investments in\nmarginalized groups, including women, rural populations, and people with disabilities, efforts to\nimprove human capital risk entrenching, rather than reducing, inequality.105\nOne of the most widely used measures to track progress in human capital and well-being is the Human\nDevelopment Index (HDI), which provides a composite snapshot of health, education, and income\noutcomes. The range of HDI values among LLDCs is considerable, spanning from just 0.388 in South\nSudan up to 0.837 in Kazakhstan, which ranks among the highest in the group and underscores the\nheterogeneity within LLDCs (Fig. 7). LLDCs that are also LDCs tend to cluster at the lower end of this\nspectrum. The 2025 HDR emphasizes that disparities in HDI between countries are deepening, and\nthat without deliberate policies to reduce inequality in human capital development, many countries,\nparticularly LDCs, risk being locked into low human development traps.106\nEducation and technical training lie at the heart of human capital development, yet LLDCs face\nprofound disparities in educational opportunities, especially along gender lines, which undermine\nprospects for inclusive growth and social cohesion. Significant gaps exist between expected years of\nschooling for girls and boys across many LLDCs, with female students often facing shorter schooling\ntrajectories. In countries like South Sudan, Niger, and Chad, these gender gaps are particularly\npronounced, reflecting systemic barriers that disproportionately affect girls’ ability to complete even\nbasic education. Conversely, LLDCs such as Mongolia and Kazakhstan show narrower differences\nbetween genders and higher overall expected years of schooling.\nThe 2025 HDR warns of unprecedented declines in learning outcomes, especially among young\nchildren, which threaten long-term skill-building and highlight the urgent need for remedial education,\nstronger teacher training, and quality learning environments. At the same time, the rapid advance of\nartificial intelligence presents both challenges and opportunities. As highlighted in both the 2019 and\n2025 HDRs, equipping people with digital and AI-related skills is now essential for enabling populations\nto seize new economic opportunities and avoid falling further behind in the Fourth Industrial\nRevolution.107\n31\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 8\nFIGURE 8\nTop 10 LLDC Recipients of Vertical Funds 2013-2024 (hundred million USD)\nLow HDI\nAFGHANISTAN Medium HDI\nARMENIA High HDI\nAZERBAIJAN Very High HDI\nBHUTAN\nBOLIVIA Female\nBOTSWANA Male\nBURKINA FASO\nBURUNDI World Average\nCENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC\nLLDC Average\nCHAD\nESWATINI\nETHIOPIA\nKAZAKHSTAN\nKYRGYZSTAN\nLAO PDR\nLESOTHO\nMALAWI\nMALI\nMOLDOVA\nMONGOLIA\nNEPAL\nNIGER\nNORTH MACEDONIA\nPARAGUAY\nRWANDA\nSOUTH SUDAN\nTAJIKISTAN\nTURKMENISTAN\nUGANDA\nUZBEKISTAN\nZAMBIA\nZIMBABWE Expected Years\n3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 of Schooling\nData Source: UNDP Human Development Report 2025 Statistical Annexes.\nUNDP’s Contribution\nBuilding on the foundations already set out on social protection and health, this section now turns to\nUNDP’s contributions in developing skills and expanding employment opportunities, key elements of\nhuman capital development that enable LLDCs to diversify their economies, increase productivity, and\nfoster inclusive growth. Across LLDCs and other vulnerable contexts, UNDP works with governments,\nthe private sector, and communities to strengthen vocational education and training systems, promote\nactive labour market policies, and improve access to entrepreneurship support. By focusing on inclusive\njob creation and practical skills development, UNDP helps ensure that women, youth, and marginalized\ngroups can participate more fully in the economy. These interventions aim to align training with labour\nmarket needs, foster sustainable livelihoods, and support economic transformation in some of the\nworld’s most geographically disadvantaged countries.\nIn Armenia, in 2024, UNDP supported more than 125,000 people, including displaced\npopulations, with livelihood support and vocational training, modernizing VET centers,\ndelivering competency-based training in areas like welding and solar energy, and rolling\nout on-the-job training.\nIn Azerbaijan, UNDP piloted digital and green skills curricula in VET programs, expanded dual\nVET slots across 30 specializations, and introduced inclusive VET courses targeting different\ngroups, including persons with disabilities, and ultimately improving job placement rates.\n32\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 8\nIn Bhutan, UNDP has strengthened career guidance services in technical training institutes\nand worked with national agencies to develop competency-based curricula, increasing\nalignment between graduates’ skills and private sector demands.\nIn Mongolia, UNDP revised national employment programs to shift from welfare-based to\nemployment-promoting systems, including profiling tools, apprenticeships, and inclusive\nvocational curricula for people with disabilities, improving alignment between VET and\nlabour market needs.\nIn Kyrgyzstan, under the SDG Investor Map, UNDP identified technical and vocational\neducation as a key investment opportunity area, helping attract private finance into\nexpanding modern, market-relevant training programs in priority sectors like irrigation and\nlogistics.\nIn Lao People’s Democratic Republic, UNDP collaborated with national ministries to revise\noccupational standards and strengthen the TVET system, including training of trainers in\ngreen skills, enhancing the employability of rural youth and facilitating transitions into\nsustainable jobs.\nIn South Sudan, UNDP trained more than 6,000 youth (over 60% women) in vocational and\nentrepreneurial skills, provided startup grants, and supported micro-enterprises, directly\ncreating livelihoods and strengthening economic resilience in conflict-affected contexts.\nCOUNTRY EXAMPLE: NORTH MACEDONIA\nNorth Macedonia has made notable progress in employment indicators over the past decade, with\nthe employment rate rising from 38.9% in 2011 to 44.1% in 2017, reflecting job creation and\neconomic growth efforts. Unemployment has continued to decline, reaching 12.5% as of June\n2024. However, structural challenges persist more than half of the working-age population\nremains unemployed or outside the labor force, and informal employment accounts for roughly\n22% of total employment, particularly in agriculture. The informal economy is estimated to\nrepresent 38% of GDP, contributing to job insecurity and limiting access to social protection.\nGender disparities remain pronounced, with a 25-percentage-point gap in labor force participation\nbetween women (44.3%) and men (69.3%), alongside a 17.5% average gender wage gap and\nlimited representation of women, especially minority women, in formal employment. Youth\nunemployment, compounded by emigration trends, continues to erode human capital,\nundermining prospects for inclusive and sustainable development.\nUNDP has played a central role in addressing employment challenges in North Macedonia by\nsupporting active labor market measures, skills development, and social inclusion initiatives.\nEmployment and livelihoods have been a top priority, and key interventions include:\n• Active Labor Market Measures and Entrepreneurship: UNDP has co-implemented flagship\ninitiatives such as “Creating Jobs for All” and the “Self-Employment Programme,” through\nwhich more than 35,000 people have applied since 2007 to establish small businesses,\nsupported by training, mentorship, and startup assistance.\n33\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 8\n• Skills Development and Job Matching: Piloting targeted training modules in key industries\n(e.g., textiles, construction, renewable energy) and coordinating with private companies to\nbetter align training with labor market needs. Initiatives like youth information clubs have\nfacilitated internships and career exploration opportunities.\n• Social Inclusion and Targeted Support: Tailored employment programs for vulnerable groups,\nincluding Roma, women, persons with disabilities, and youth, have provided mentorship, skills\ntraining, and support for formalizing work in emerging areas such as the care economy.\n• Private Sector and SME Support: Through platforms like “bizz4all.mk,” UNDP has promoted\nentrepreneurship and SME growth to foster an innovative business ecosystem and connect\njob seekers with business opportunities.\n• Policy and Institutional Strengthening: UNDP has contributed to shaping national\nemployment policies and strengthening institutional capacities of key stakeholders, improving\nframeworks for inclusive and productive employment.\nLOOKING AHEAD\nThe Awaza Programme of Action (2024–2034) recognizes that investing in human capital is essential for\nLLDCs to overcome the compounded challenges of geographic isolation, limited connectivity, and\nnarrow economic bases, identifying it as a top priority for the decade ahead. It commits LLDCs and their\npartners to strengthen health, nutrition, and social protection systems, while ensuring universal access\nto inclusive, equitable, and quality education — including early childhood, primary, secondary, and\naffordable technical, vocational, and tertiary education. The plan underscores the need to modernize\ntechnical and vocational education and training (TVET) systems and develop digital skills to enable\nparticipation in modern, diversified economies. It also stresses creating decent, productive employment\nopportunities for youth, women, and marginalized groups through job-rich economic diversification and\nsupport for entrepreneurship and MSMEs. Recognizing that half of the LLDCs are also LDCs, the Awaza\nPoA aligns closely with the Doha Programme of Action for LDCs, which shares these commitments to\nenhancing human assets through integrated investments in education, skills development, health, social\nprotection, and decent work.\nUNDP places human capital at the center of its strategic objective Prosperity for All, emphasizing the\nexpansion of opportunities for decent jobs, livelihoods, and productive assets, while modernizing social\nprotection systems to address evolving vulnerabilities, including those stemming from climate and\ntechnological change. UNDP recognizes the urgency of equipping people with digital and\nentrepreneurial skills, strengthening entrepreneurial ecosystems, and advancing financial inclusion,\nespecially for women, youth, and rural communities. As such, it emphasizes targeted support to\nintegrate women’s economic agency and to build institutional capacity for aligning national\ndevelopment strategies with financing mechanisms that expand human capital. Importantly, UNDP\nexplicitly commits to supporting both the Awaza and Doha Programmes of Action, and looking ahead,\nwill intensify efforts to help LLDCs strengthen health and education systems, close digital divides,\nmodernize TVET, and foster inclusive labor markets. Through these integrated solutions, UNDP will\nsupport LLDCs and LDCs in building resilient, inclusive, and competitive economies, accelerating\nprogress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and ensuring that no one is left behind.\n34\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 9\nFinancing Sustainable Development in LLDCs: Debt\nisn’t just a burden - it is a crisis hindering the path\nto sustainable development and inclusive growth\nThe development financing landscape of LLDCs is characterized by persistent aid dependence, rising\ndebt vulnerabilities, and limited access to productive investments, reflecting both the structural\nconstraints LLDCs face and the broader challenges of financing development in a volatile global\nenvironment.\nOfficial Development Assistance (ODA) has remained an important pillar of external financing for\nLLDCs over the past decade. Between 2014 and 2023, total ODA disbursed to LLDCs rose from USD\n26.1 billion to USD 32.1 billion, reflecting a modest but steady increase in nominal terms. However, this\ngrowth has not translated into increased significance relative to national economies: the median\nODA-to-GNI ratio across LLDCs has remained broadly stagnant, fluctuating around 2 percent over the\npast decade. This suggests that while ODA volumes have grown, their proportional impact relative to\nthe size of LLDC economies has not kept pace. While LLDCs account for a small share of global ODA\n(approximately 8–10 percent), they consistently receive higher levels of ODA on a per capita basis than\nother developing country groupings, nearly double the global average108. The significance of these\nflows within national budgets is large. In many LLDCs, particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa and South\nAsia, ODA constitutes over 20 percent of government expenditure, underscoring the continued reliance\non external support to meet development objectives.\nODA allocations to LLDCs have also remained highly uneven and concentrated. A small number of\ncountries, including Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Uganda, South Sudan, and Mali, have consistently received a\nsubstantial share of total ODA to the group. As illustrated in Figure 11, these five countries alone\naccounted for nearly half of all ODA disbursements to LLDCs between 2014 and 2023. This\nconcentration reflects both geopolitical priorities and relative absorptive capacity.\nAt the same time, public debt in LLDCs has surged dramatically, driven by a combination of external\neconomic shocks, limited access to trade, and growing dependency on external financing to fund\nessential infrastructure and development projects. According to the IMF, as of September 2024, five of\nthe eleven countries classified as being in debt distress are LLDCs, including Ethiopia, Malawi, Laos,\nZimbabwe, and Zambia, facing acute challenges in meeting their debt obligations, while seven more are\nat high risk, leaving them highly vulnerable to external shocks that could further destabilize their fiscal\npositions.\nSince around 2011, developing economies have experienced what has been termed the “fourth wave of\ndebt”- a period marked by a sustained and widespread rise in public and private borrowing across\nemerging markets and low-income countries. Unlike previous debt waves, this one has unfolded amid\nsluggish economic growth, persistently tight global financial conditions, and a shrinking pool of\nconcessional finance. Successive shocks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate-related disasters,\nand heightened geopolitical instability, have further intensified fiscal pressures. For many countries,\nincluding LLDCs, this has created a vicious cycle, where rising debt service burdens constrain\ninvestments in development.\n35\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 9\nFIGURE 9\nOfficial Development Assistance Disbursements 2014 - 2023 (million USD)\n40,000\n35,000\n30,000\n25,000\nAFGHANISTAN\n20,000 ETHIOPIA\nUGANDA\n15,000 SOUTH SUDAN\nMALI\n10,000\nREMAINING LLDCs\n5,000\n0\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\nSource: Based on IMF World Economic Outlook, October 2024\nThese global dynamics are playing out with a growing intensity at the country level. Net interest\npayments as a share of government revenue have increased steeply over the past decade, with the\nmedian ratio for developing economies projected to reach 9.5 percent by 2025, the highest level in\nmore than two decades109. While LLDCs are generally below this median (Fig. 10), they have not been\nspared from the upward trajectory, recording steady increases in debt service burdens, although with\nsomewhat less severe exposure than the most indebted peers. Nonetheless, LLDCs remain structurally\ndisadvantaged: facing higher effective borrowing costs, limited access to concessional finance, and\nconstrained revenue bases, which amplify the fiscal strain. The widening interquartile range in recent\nyears also signals growing divergence among countries, with some LLDCs moving closer to high-risk\nthresholds.\nIn Africa, LLDCs have seen particularly sharp debt increases due to volatile commodity prices, high\nborrowing costs, and the impacts of climate change, which strain fiscal resources and compel countries\nto rely heavily on international debt. In Central Asia, LLDCs face similar debt pressures, amplified by\nreduced economic growth, political instability, and limited diversification in economic sectors, leaving\nthem vulnerable to external shifts in energy and resource markets. The rise in debt levels threatens\ndevelopment progress, and underscores the need for innovative financing solutions and global support\ntailored to the unique vulnerabilities of LLDCs.\nDespite its potential to catalyse sustainable development, FDI in LLDCs has remained insufficient and\nhighly concentrated. According to UNCTAD, FDI flows to the 32 LLDCs reached US $24 billion in 2023,\nbut these inflows declined on average by 2 percent per year since 2014. As a result, the LLDC share of\nglobal developing-country FDI shrank from 4.3 percent in 2014 to just 2.8 percent in 2023. Moreover,\nFDI remains dominated by a few economies, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and\nUganda, which together received about 60 percent of total inflows during that period. While sectoral\ndistributions have shifted, greenfield investment in extractives dropped from 32% to 20%, and services\n36\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 9\nprojects rose from 27% to 47%, most investments continue to be confined to primary sectors rather than\nmanufacturing or infrastructure. Although some LLDCs have successfully increased public–private\npartnerships in power and transport, overall FDI remains both narrow in sectoral scope and insufficient\nin scale to significantly boost productive capacities or diversify economies110.\nFIGURE 10\nGeneral Government Net Interest Payments as Percentage of Revenue (2000–2025)\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n7\n0\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024\nMedian Interquartile range\nSource: Based on IMF World Economic Outlook, October 2024\nNote: Net interests are calculated as the difference between the overall and primary balance.\nAccessible at: Updated figures available at https://data.undp.org/insights/debt-in-developing-economies.\n37\nseuneveR\nfo\n%\nsa\ntseretnI\nteN\nFourth Wave of Debt\nprojects rose from 27% to 47%, most investments continue to be confined to primary sectors rather than\nmanufacturing or infrastructure.

Through targeted partnerships and country-level engagement, UNDP has\nworked to identify SDG-aligned investment opportunities and convene dialogues to raise awareness\namong investors about the development and commercial potential of such investments in LLDC\ncontexts.\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 9\nFLAGSHIP PROGRAMME: INTEGRATED NATIONAL FINANCING FRAMEWORK (INFF) FACILITY\nThe INFF Facility is a joint initiative led by UNDP, UN DESA, OECD, UNICEF, the European Union, and the\ngovernments of Italy, Spain, and Sweden. It supports countries in designing and operationalizing an\nINFF, aimed at strengthening the alignment of public and private financing with national development\nstrategies. The Facility provides tailored technical assistance, fosters collaboration across government,\nprivate sector, and civil society, and offers a platform for peer learning and access to innovative tools and\nguidance.\nTo date, over 85 countries globally have adopted the INFF approach including 23 of the 32 LLDCs and\nwith a focus on strengthening financial governance, mobilizing diverse sources of finance, and\npromoting inclusive financing strategies. These efforts aim to create sustainable, transparent, and\nefficient financial ecosystems that accelerate progress toward the SDGs and reflect the specific\ndevelopment constraints and opportunities faced by LLDCs.\nExamples:\nIn Malawi, the INFF process aims to strengthen the country’s\n23\nfinancing architecture in support of essential social service\ndelivery at the local level.\nLLDCs\nIn Kazakhstan, the INFF will support the government’s ambition\nare actively engaging in\nto improve the efficiency, effectiveness and transparency of\nthe development of the use of public funds and governance of private finance.\nINFFS\nBurkina Faso aims to mobilize all internal and external sources\nof finance in support of its national development plan and\nthe SDGs.\nStrengthening financial governance, mobilizing diverse resources, and promoting inclusive\nfinancing are core pillars of the INFF approach in LLDCs. Countries such as Armenia, Bhutan,\nBotswana, and Burkina Faso are improving public financial management and domestic resource\nmobilization, while Malawi, and Mongolia are diversifying finance through investments in green energy\nand increased private sector engagement.\nInclusive financing strategies are advancing in Burundi, Lesotho, Lao PDR, and Kyrgyzstan, with a focus\non public–private collaboration and stakeholder engagement. In Nepal and Tajikistan, financing plans\nare being tailored to address the needs of marginalized groups, including women and rural\ncommunities.\nUNDP has supported Development Finance Assessments in 11 LLDCs. Many of these countries are\nnow transitioning from diagnostic to action, developing integrated financing strategies and establishing\nINFF Oversight Committees to institutionalize reforms, strengthen inter-ministerial coordination, and\nreinforce national ownership of financing priorities.\n38\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 9\nCOUNTRY EXAMPLE: LESOTHO\nIn Lesotho, UNDP’s support to the INFF, in collaboration with UNICEF and IOM, has catalyzed a\nstrategic shift toward gender-responsive and sustainable financing. Facing declining revenues\nfrom the Southern African Customs Union and ODA, and a growing fiscal deficit, Lesotho is\nleveraging the INFF process to bridge a LSL 3.3 billion financing gap in its National Strategic\nDevelopment Plan II and advance SDG implementation.\nA key innovation has been the mainstreaming of gender equality into the country’s financing\narchitecture. Building on insights from the 2021 DFA, where over a quarter of recommendations\nfocused on women’s empowerment, the INFF integrates UN Women’s guidance on gender\nmainstreaming. This has led to gender audits in key ministries, revisions to labour regulations, and\nthe piloting of gender-responsive budgeting by the Ministry of Finance.111 Support for the National\nGender and Development Policy (2018–2030), developed jointly with UNFPA, has further\ninstitutionalized gender equality across development planning.\nLesotho’s INFF now promotes inclusive public-private partnerships and has established new CSO\nengagement frameworks for budget accountability, with an emphasis on gender and climate.\nThese efforts are helping to advance fiscal sustainability, empower women, and strengthen\nalignment with international and regional development commitments.\nLOOKING AHEAD\nThe Programme of Action for LLDCs for the Decade 2024–2034 acknowledges that many LLDCs are\nalready in, or at high risk of, debt distress, aggravated by limited economic diversification, declining FDI,\nand dependence on a narrow range of commodities. These internal vulnerabilities are compounded by\nexternal shocks, including global market volatility and trade pressures. Notably, recent analyses\nhighlight the disproportionate impact of U.S. tariffs on developing countries, which in some cases may\nharm export revenues and resilience more than the absence of aid⁵. High debt burdens are constraining\nfiscal space and limiting the policy choices available to invest in infrastructure, social protection, and\nstructural transformation. In response, the Programme calls for stronger international cooperation to\nsupport debt sustainability through concessional finance, debt restructuring, and capacity-building in\ndebt management. It also stresses the need to reduce illicit financial flows and enhance domestic\nresource mobilization to build a more resilient and self-reliant development path.\nUNDP views financing as a critical accelerator for sustainable development, with its Strategic Plan\nplacing strong emphasis on transforming how development is financed. In contexts where debt distress\nand limited fiscal space hinder progress, UNDP supports countries in building integrated, inclusive, and\nforward-looking financing systems. This includes helping governments design and implement\nIntegrated National Financing Frameworks, enhance public financial management, leverage private and\nblended finance, and access climate and concessional financing. Recognizing that finance must work for\npeople and the planet, UNDP also promotes gender-responsive and risk-informed budgeting, stronger\ntax systems, and transparency in public spending. In LLDCs, where structural vulnerabilities intersect\nwith constrained connectivity and external shocks, UNDP’s offer aims to unlock investments in\nresilience, productivity, and regional integration. Through policy advice, digital tools, capacity-building,\nand partnerships across sectors, UNDP works to ensure that financing becomes a transformative\nenabler — not a bottleneck — for inclusive, green, and sustainable development.\n39\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 10\nDriving Digital Transformation in LLDCs\nThe digital landscape of LLDCs is characterized by significant gaps in internet and digital connectivity.\nOnly 39% of the population in LLDCs uses the Internet, whereas over 80% of people in developed\ncountries have Internet access.112 This gap is primarily due to affordability, lack of necessary skills, and\ninsufficient local content. These obstacles hinder technological innovation and economic development.\nExpanding connectivity and digital transformation in LLDCs is crucial, focusing on connecting\nhard-to-reach communities - enabling the provision of digital services to vulnerable and isolated\ncommunities. LLDCs need support to develop and expand broadband networks and mobile\nconnectivity, promote digital literacy programs, and create platforms for their people, particularly young\npeople, to access digital technologies, improving digital skills and digital literacy.\nFIGURE 10\nProportion of individuals who used the Internet from any location (via a fixed or mobile network) in the last\nthree months (%)\nSource: https://datahub.itu.int/data/?i=11624 (ITU)\nDigital technologies have the capacity to transform development priorities. Internet connectivity\npresents excellent opportunities for LLDCs, which encounter geographical and structural challenges.\nImproving internet connectivity in LLDCs would enable the exchange of information and services,\nenabling businesses to access global markets without being heavily dependent on physical\ninfrastructure. Furthermore, ICTs can improve transportation and logistics efficiency, lower trade costs,\nand enhance public service delivery in areas such as education and health. LLDCs have great potential\nin ICTs, but they are not competitive in this area and rely heavily on importing ICT goods. Over the past\ndecade, the percentage of ICT goods that LLDCs export compared to their total trade has stayed below\n1%, just 0.6% in 2021. This is very different from the global trend, which saw a 4% increase in ICT goods\nexports after COVID-19.\n40\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 10\nRecent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) also provide huge opportunities for development. AI\ncan increase productivity, support education and human capital development, generate real-time\ninsights from non-conventional data to inform policy, and drive sustainable development.113 However,\nirresponsible use of AI can cause data privacy violations, cybersecurity risks, misinformation and erosion\nof trust, and environmental damage.114 Unequal access to AI will amplify the existing digital divide and\ncreate further inequality.115 To harness the potential of AI, while ensuring its responsible and equitable\nuse in supporting development, countries will need strategies and frameworks for the regulation of AI.\nHowever, almost no LLDCs have comprehensive strategies regarding AI.\nUNDP’s Contribution\nIn Armenia, Bolivia, Kyrgyzstan, North Macedonia, and Moldova, UNDP has conducted Digital Readiness\nAssessments to design digital interventions and implement inclusive public services. UNDP has also\nsupported the development of national AI Landscape Assessment (AILA) and has supported the\ndevelopment of a national AI strategy in Mongolia.\nIn Armenia117, Kyrgyzstan118, Kazakhstan119, and Uzbekistan120, UNDP has initiated programmes that\nprovide training for digital literacy and human capital development, allowing individuals to better utilise\ndigital technologies for learning, income generation, and entrepreneurship. These programmes target\nthe youth, as LLDCs often have large youth populations, but often deal with major youth unemployment.\nUNDP has worked with 13+ countries, including LLDCs such as Malawi, in developing Smart Health\nFacilities: digitally enabled infrastructure that address challenges facing health systems.121 These smart\nhealth facilities can support supply chain logistics, medical waste management, health information\nsystems, effective care delivery, and pandemic preparedness and response. Through the programme,\n45,000 smart health facilities have been in operation worldwide, helping deliver over 2.7 billion Covid-19\nvaccines, and saving $3 for health facilities for every $1 invested.122\nUNDP has supported the development of innovative digital solutions for development challenges with\nthe Digital X project.123 UNDP supported the implementation of Digital Governance Innovation and\nTransformation (DGIT) legal identity systems in Malawi, which allowed 10 million digital ID cards to be\nissued to provide access to various government services.124 UNDP also supported Safe YOU, an app\nthat allows victims of gender based violence to issue emergency alerts to authorities and connect with\nother victims for support, which has saved at least 2 lives and has led to several cases of prosecution in\nArmenia.125\nIn Kyrgyzstan, UNDP is supporting the digital transformation of climate risk and disaster risk reduction\nthrough the integration of new technologies for communicating risk information, including updating\nnational disaster monitoring systems with modern software and hardware that enables satellite data\naccess. Early-warning avalanche stations improved risk assessments and early warnings to over 60,000\nresidents, and fire and rescue systems benefitted around 400,000 people.126\nCOUNTRY CASE: SOUTH SUDAN\nIn South Sudan, communities traditionally have saved money using a financial institution called\nsanduk, which means “box”.127 The sanduk pools the savings of community members, and lends\nthe funds to those in need at an interest rate set by the community. However, communities\ndepending on sanduk now face challenges such as high-interest rates and limited access to credit,\nlimiting the funds available for entrepreneurs and informal cross border traders. For example, in\n41\nPROGRAMMATIC AREA 10\n2021, sanduk interest rates were set at 30% in the Wararawar Peace market. These challenges\nhave led to mounting debt and financial strain for communities who live in vulnerable borderland\ncommunities, who have little access to formal financial services.128\nUNDP has led interventions to support the digitization of sanduk to improve access to capital,\nincrease transparency, and support saving.129 The digitalization was done by mapping the concept\nof sanduk onto mobile digital platforms. This facilitated the accurate tracking of transactions, as\nwell as created group financial profiles, which allowed banks and other formal institutions to\nextend financial services to members.\nThrough the programme, the implementation of digital sanduk caused a significant decrease in\ninterest rates, dropping from a high of 30% in 2021 to between 15%-20%.130 This reduction of\ninterest rates increased community participation in sanduk, which subsequently increased the\nlending power of sanduk. Thus, more members were able to access loans for education and\nemergency medical treatment. Access to financial services for vulnerable populations, who\notherwise have limited access to formal financial services, has significantly increased. The success\nof the digitalization of sanduk in bringing more accessible financial services to vulnerable\nborderland communities provides a framework for future programmes aiming to digitize and\nexpand access to financial services.\nLOOKING AHEAD\nLooking forward, the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) also poses future challenges for\ndevelopment. UNDP will need to support the implementation of national AI landscape assessments in\nLLDCs.131 UNDP will also need to support countries with AI for human capital development, training,\nmarket trends, and forecasting skills, allowing individuals and LLDCs to harness the productive and\neconomic benefits of AI.\nA major focus of future interventions should revolve around youth in LLDCs. LLDCs are\ndisproportionately young, with youth making up a larger proportion of the population than other\ncountries. To support youth in an increasingly digitised world, and reduce youth unemployment trends\ncommon in many LLDCs, interventions need to focus on increasing digital literacy and human capital\ndevelopment.\nThe development of the digital services economy, such as IT, digital creative industry, or financial\nservice exports, are important for LLDCs, as they can be exported without being impacted by the\ngeographical limitations that landlocked countries face. Future interventions need to consider the\npossibility that AI can exacerbate existing inequalities and further the digital divide. Digital is\neverywhere, and is becoming essential for individuals to operate in society, access government and\nfinancial services, and conduct everyday transactions. Thus, there is the risk for those without access to\ndigital technologies to be excluded from services if everything is digitalized. UNDP must continue to\nwork with LLDCs to expand digital infrastructure and connectivity, increasing the number of individuals\nin LLDCs that have access to the internet and digital services. Future interventions need to ensure that\nthose without access to digital services can either obtain access or have the ability to access services.\n42\nEnabling Sustainable Graduation: On\nthe Path Out of LDC Status\n16 of the 32 LLDCs are also classified as LDCs, a dual status that reflects the compounded development\nchallenges they face due to both geographic isolation and deep structural economic vulnerabilities.132\nThese countries encounter persistent barriers like high trade costs, limited infrastructure connectivity,\nand dependence on a narrow range of commodities, all of which impede sustained progress on key\nhuman and economic development indicators.133\nFIGURE 13\nMapping LDCs among LLDCs\nLDCs\nNon-LDCs\nLatin American Eastern Europe & Central Asia Sub-Saharan Africa Sub-Saharan Africa East Asia and the Pacific\nBOLIVIA ARMENIA BOTSWANA MALAWI LAO PDR\nPARAGUAY AZERBAIJAN BURKINA FASO MALI MONGOLIA\nKAZAKHSTAN BURUNDI NIGER\nSouth Asia\nKYRGYZSTAN CENTRAL AFRICAN REP.

Many LLDC-LDCs struggle with consistently low scores on the\nHAI and EVI, reflecting chronic poverty, weak education and health systems, and heightened exposure\nto external shocks134. These challenges are compounded by their landlocked geography, which\nincreases average trade costs by up to 50 percent compared to coastal LDCs, limiting competitiveness\nand discouraging investment in value-added industries.135\n43\nprojects rose from 27% to 47%, most investments continue to be confined to primary sectors rather than\nmanufacturing or infrastructure. Although some LLDCs have successfully increased public–private\npartnerships in power and transport, overall FDI remains both narrow in sectoral scope and insufficient\nin scale to significantly boost productive capacities or diversify economies.\nNonetheless, there have been important signs of progress. Bhutan became the first LLDC to graduate\nfrom LDC status in nearly three decades when it successfully transitioned in December 2023. Bhutan’s\ngraduation followed years of steady economic growth, social investments, and effective coordination of\nits transition strategy with UN agencies, demonstrating that even landlocked countries can meet\ngraduation thresholds with strong governance and targeted support.136 Meanwhile, Nepal and Laos\nhave met the graduation criteria in consecutive reviews (2018 and 2021) and are scheduled to graduate\nin November 2026, pending successful implementation of their preparatory and smooth transition\nstrategies.137\nFIGURE 14\nLDC Graduation Criteria Status\nMeets Threshold\nAfghanistan Approaching Threshold\nFar from Threshold\nBurkina Faso Thresholds:\nGNI ≥ 1,306 USD\nHAI ≥ 66\nBurundi EVI ≤ 32\nCAR\nChad\nEthiopia\nLao PDR\nLesotho\nMalawi\nMali\nNepal\nNiger\nRwanda\nSouth Sudan\nUganda\nZambia\n44\nHowever, for many other LLDC-LDCs, graduation remains a distant prospect. Countries like Afghanistan,\nBurkina Faso, Burundi, Central African Republic, Malawi, Mali, Niger and South Sudan continue to face\ninstability, protracted crises, and vulnerability to external shocks, including commodity price volatility and\nclimate-related disasters, that stall progress on both income and human assets indicators.138\nRecognizing these challenges, countries approaching graduation require smooth transition strategies\nlasting at least three years post-graduation. These strategies aim to consolidate development gains,\nmaintain access to key international support measures, and strengthen resilience to shocks, ensuring\nthat graduation is both sustainable and inclusive.139\nOver the past decade, UNDP has played a critical role in supporting the graduation of LLDCs that are\nalso LDCs, recognizing the vulnerabilities these countries face due to remoteness from global markets,\nstructural economic weaknesses, and heightened exposure to external shocks.140 UNDP’s assistance\nhas included technical advice on meeting graduation criteria, capacity-building for national statistical\nand planning institutions, and support to develop smooth transition strategies that aim to consolidate\ngraduation gains and minimize risks of reversal.141\nFor Bhutan and Nepal, UNDP has provided extensive policy and programmatic support tailored to their\nunique contexts. In Bhutan, UNDP’s engagement was aligned with the 12th Five-Year Plan which\nprioritized the strengthening of governance institutions to ensure sustainable graduation¹¹. Recognizing\nthat strong and efficient governance is essential for maintaining progress post-graduation, UNDP\nsupported the Royal Government of Bhutan’s commitment to decentralization, including a pledge to\nallocate 50 percent of the national budget to local governments. Between 2018 and 2019, UNDP helped\nlead a comprehensive review of Bhutan’s local governance structures and relevant normative Acts—an\neffort directly overseen by the Prime Minister¹¹. Although the onset of COVID-19 in 2020 required UNDP\nand the government to redirect resources toward immediate health and crisis response, this flexibility\nhelped Bhutan avoid setbacks that could have threatened its graduation, while continued support for\nthe Local Government Election ensured democratic processes and institutional resilience were\npreserved.142\nIn Nepal, UNDP has worked with the National Planning Commission to develop integrated planning\nframeworks aligned with both the graduation agenda and the SDGs, ensuring that social, economic, and\nenvironmental dimensions are addressed in tandem. In both countries, UNDP has partnered with\nMinistries of Finance and Planning to prepare for the eventual loss of LDC-specific international support\nmeasures, including trade preferences and concessional financing.143\n.\nUNDP has strengthened the evidence base on graduation challenges by analyzing emerging issues\naffecting African LDCs in today’s development landscape and examining the implications of graduation\nfor trade preferences and development financing in Asia-Pacific. These insights are captured in two\nrecent publications: Graduation of African Least Developed Countries (LDC): Emerging Issues in a New\nDevelopment Landscape (2021), and Graduation from LDC Status: Implications for Trade Preference and\nDevelopment Financing in Asia-Pacific.\nUNDP plays a convening role by bringing together governments, regional bodies, development\npartners, and the private sector to coordinate support for LLDC-LDCs. This integrated approach aligns\nnational policies with international frameworks such as the Awaza Declaration and Plan of Action for\nLLDCs (2024–2034), and the Doha Programme of Action for LDCs (2022–2031) to ensure that\ngraduating countries are better prepared to sustain progress and continue advancing towards\nmiddle-income status after graduation.144\n45\nLooking Ahead: UNDP and the Next\nDecade of Partnership with LLDCs\nAs Landlocked Developing Countries enter a new phase under the Programme of Action for the\nDecade 2024–2034, UNDP stands ready to deepen its longstanding partnership. Building on 60 years\nof global development experience and a decade of targeted support under the Vienna Programme of\nAction, UNDP brings a robust platform of integrated policy, financing, and implementation support to\nhelp LLDCs navigate the structural and emerging challenges of this new era.\nToday’s development landscape is shaped by intersecting crises: economic instability, debt distress,\nclimate shocks, and technological disruption. Many LLDCs, particularly those also classified as Least\nDeveloped Countries (LDCs), face compounded vulnerabilities that demand more agile, anticipatory,\nand systemic responses. In this context, LLDCs are not only at the frontline of global development\nchallenges, but also pivotal to global solutions—strategically located at the heart of regional value\nchains, climate-vulnerable ecosystems, and migration pathways. The next decade must be about\nunlocking this untapped potential.\nUNDP’s priorities for the future are aligned with the priorities of the new LLDC agenda, placing emphasis\non “prosperity for all”, effective governance, crisis resilience, and a healthy planet, with accelerators in\ndigital and AI transformation, gender equality, and sustainable finance. These areas are deeply relevant\nfor LLDCs. Going forward, UNDP will:\n▪ Advance integrated, country-led solutions to support economic diversification, regional\nconnectivity, and resilience to external shocks;\n▪ Scale up support to human capital development, focusing on future-ready skills, employment,\nand inclusive social protection systems;\n▪ Promote sustainable financing, including expanded use of Integrated National Financing\nFrameworks and access to blended finance for LLDC priorities;\n▪ Support climate resilience and energy transitions, particularly in high-risk and\nresource-constrained LLDCs;\n▪ Leverage digital transformation to improve access, efficiency, and participation in governance,\nmarkets, and services;\n▪ Enable structural transformation in critical sectors such as natural resource governance,\nextractive industries, and MSMEs.\nCrucially, UNDP’s embedded presence in all 32 LLDCs ensures that these global goals are translated\ninto locally owned, nationally led development solutions. With its trusted partnerships, commitment to\nleaving no one behind, and experience in fragile and complex settings, UNDP is uniquely positioned to\nhelp LLDCs not only adapt but lead in this uncertain global context.\nTogether with LLDCs and the international community, UNDP will co-create a future where landlocked\ngeography is no longer a constraint, but a platform for innovation, inclusion, and sustainable prosperity.\n46\nENDNOTES\n1 UNDP.

As the global community accelerates efforts to meet the 2030 Agenda, it is in-\ncreasingly clear: gender justice is foundational to peace, sustainable development, and the realization\nof human rights.\nIn 2024, the Gender Justice Platform advanced its vision of inclusive justice through bold and collective\naction. Co-led by UNDP and UN Women and made possible through the generous support of the Ministry\nof Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(BMZ) of Germany, and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) of the United\nKingdom, the Platform deepened its impact across 45 countries and territories. Together, we supported\nover 80 justice institutions, extended legal protection and aid to more than 125,000 people, most of them\nwomen, and elevated women’s leadership in the world’s most complex and fragile contexts.\nOur results go beyond outputs, pointing to meaningful progress toward long-term change. From Guin-\nea-Bissau to Yemen, the Platform helped deliver survivor-centred legal services. In South Sudan and\nNepal, women leaders shaped constitutional processes. In Latin America and Caribbean, Africa, and\nSoutheast Asia, civil society and governments co-developed strategies to dismantle discriminatory\nlaws and institutionalize equality. These achievements are rooted in intersectional approaches, local\nownership, and a commitment to justice as both a process and an outcome.\nThe Platform has grown into a vital multistakeholder mechanism, contributing to UN coordination an\nengine of innovation while providing space for co-creation, and a driver of feminist justice systems. Its\nwork directly supports the Women, Peace and Security Agenda, the New Agenda for Peace, and UNDP’s\nGender Equality Strategy and Crisis Offer. It is aligned with the 2024 Pact for the Future, reinforcing the\ninseparability of peace, human rights, and development. Most importantly, it responds to the urgent call\nof women’s movements around the world: to move from commitments to concrete results.\nWe are especially grateful to the government institutions, justice actors, feminist organizations, and\ngrassroots leaders who continue to make this work possible. Their insights, determination, and leader-\nship are at the heart of every achievement and innovation.\nThe road ahead remains challenging. Women and marginalized groups continue to face discriminatory\nlaws, underfunded justice institutions, and shrinking civic space, especially in conflict and crisis settings.\nBut with courageous partnerships and sustained investment, the Gender Justice Platform will continue\nto deliver where it matters most: ensuring justice systems and mechanisms are people-centred, and\ntruly serve women and girls, their communities and societies.\nKaty Thompson Paivi Kannisto\nCo-Director, Governance, Rule of Law and Chief, Peace, Security and Resilience Section\nPeacebuilding (GRP) Hub United Nations UN Women\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP)\nForeword 5\nIntroduction\nIn a global landscape marked by rising conflict, democratic backsliding, and shrinking civic space, the\nGender Justice Platform (GJP) has remained a steadfast champion for the rights of women and girls.\nIn 2024, nearly a quarter of governments worldwide reported a backlash on women’s rights, and 2025\nstarted with a worrying decrease of official development assistance (ODA), particularly impacting work\non human rights and gender equality.1 In this challenging context, in 2024, the Platform deepened its\ncommitment to advancing gender justice by driving legal reforms to eliminate discriminatory laws,\npromote equal rights and strengthening survivor-centred approaches, and promoting inclusive justice\nsystems. Building on the momentum of prior years, the GJP continued to provide direct support in\ncrisis-and fragility-affected contexts, while scaling innovative regional and global initiatives to close\njustice gaps and expand women’s leadership across the rule of law and security sectors.\nAmid declining development assistance to justice institutions and limited investment in women’s jus-\ntice needs, the GJP has served as a vital mechanism to mobilize expertise, catalyze partnerships, and\nchannel resources where they are most urgently needed. With over 50 strategic partners since its\nimplementation and a growing portfolio of work in fragile and conflict-affected settings, the Platform\nhas supported justice services reaching more than 249,000 people—in 2024, 63 percent of whom are\nwomen. From transitional justice processes in Colombia and Ukraine to regional leadership networks\nin Asia and the Balkans, the Platform’s work is grounded in people-centred, feminist approaches and\naligned with global frameworks, including the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals.\nAs gender-based violence intensifies and barriers to justice deepen, the Gender Justice Platform\ncontinues to play a catalytic role, bridging normative commitments with practical action. In the face of\nrising threats to gender equality, the Platform’s work is more relevant than ever. As the 25th anniver-\nsary of the United Nations Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on Women, Peace and Security\napproaches in October 2025, the Platform reaffirms its commitment to ensuring that women’s voic-\nes, rights, and leadership are central to peacebuilding and justice processes. By amplifying women’s\nvoices, fostering legal empowerment, and advancing institutional accountability, the GJP is laying the\ngroundwork for more just, inclusive, and resilient societies. This report presents the key results, strate-\ngic partnerships, and lessons learned from 2024, showcasing how the Platform is sharing knowledge\nand transforming commitments into concrete change for women and girls around the world. It should\nbe read as a complement to the UNDP Rule of Law and Human Rights Annual Report for 2024\n1 UN Women, Women’s rights in review 30 years after Beijing (2025), https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/\npublications/2025/03/womens-rights-in-review-30-years-after-beijing.\nIntroduction 6\nMain Highlights\nIn 2024, the Gender Justice Platform supported 45 countries and territories to strengthen\nrule of law systems that advance the rights and access to justice for women and girls. This was\nachieved through technical, financial, and policy support, in collaboration with strategic partners\nfrom the United Nations, including the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Office of\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR); external partners such as the International\nDevelopment Law Organization (IDLO), the World Bank, and Justice Rapid Response; and civil\nsociety organizations, including the Tanzania Women Judges Association, the Global Justice\nCenter, and Partners in Justice International.\n79,477 women and girls (from a total of 125,264 people) accessed justice services through formal\nand informal justice mechanisms at the country and regional level; and 76,423 women (from a\ntotal of 122,053 people) received legal information and awareness through targeted campaigns\nand innovative solutions provided and supported by the Platform (including mobile courts, legal\nclinics and others).\n520 women, including survivors of Conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV), participated in\naccountability and reparations initiatives in Colombia, Kosovo,2 Kenya, Mali, The Philippines and\nUkraine. 640 commission staff, investigators and prosecutors received specialized training on\nsurvivor-centered approaches and accountability for CRSV, strengthening institutional capacity\nto deliver justice for survivors.\n709 women parliamentarians and women youth received strategic training and support through\nthe Platform to meaningfully participate in constitution-making and legal reform processes in\nGuatemala, Montenegro, South Sudan and Tanzania.\n82 formal and informal justice institutions and systems were supported to deliver people-centered\nservices with a focus on women and girls. Notably, in 2024 the Platform supported 34 informal\njustice actors, including Civil Society Organizations and alternative d ispute resolution mechanisms\nin Colombia, Guatemala, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Montenegro, Mozambique, Nepal, Philippines,\nSenegal, Ukraine, Tanzania and Yemen.\n2 All references to Kosovo in this report shall be understood to be in the context of Security Council resolution\n1244 (1999).\nMain Highlights 7\nThe Platform deepened its collaboration with feminist civil society organizations and associations\nsuch as Women's Peace Initiative Alliance from Colombia and Associations of Women Judges in\nGuinea-Bissau, Tanzania and Senegal, ensuring that their legal, advocacy, and research expertise\ninfluenced national legal reforms and global norm-setting processes. Since 2022, the Platform\nhas collaborated with more than 50 partners, reinforcing its role as a catalyst for inclusive, rights-\nbased justice systems.\nThe Platform contributed to global thought leadership by developing and supporting 20 innovative\ntools and methodologies, and 36 research, knowledge, learning and policy products addressing\ncritical issues such as the reform of discriminatory laws and transitional justice. In response to the\npersistent challenges of financing for development, the Platform spearheaded the production of\nthe global report Financing Women’s Justice Needs: Global Perspectives on Violence Against\nWomen, and a Case Study on Uganda, in partnership with Pathfinders for Peaceful, Just and\nInclusive Societies, IDLO, the World Bank Group, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation\nand Development (OECD), to determine the extent to which national budgets are taking women’s\njustice needs and responses for gender-based violence. The findings were strategically launched\nat the 2024 session of the Commission on the Status of Women, catalyzing global dialogue on\nfinancing justice for women and girls.\nMain Highlights 8\nParliamentarians, government officials, and civil\nsociety representatives participating of the Global\nMultistakeholder Summit on Advancing Gender\nEquality in Nationality laws. ©UN Women.\n01.

This structural\ndisparity, also present in Nigeria, reveals how religion and tradition reinforce gender bias and must\nbe directly addressed in justice reform strategies.\nOther justice actors must be considered to support women’s participation, with attention to the\nlegal system\nIn common law systems, judicial appointments often rely on male-dominated recommendation\nprocesses, limiting women’s access due to unequal political networks. Ensuring women’s presence\nin appointing bodies and leadership roles is critical to increasing their representation on the bench.\nGender sensitive procedures for women’s effective participation are useful, but political will can\nhave a greater impact\nWomen’s representation increases when more qualified candidates are available, but recruitment\nprocesses alone do not drive change. Without political will, quotas risk remaining symbolic, as\nseen in Malawi. In contrast, Ghana and Nigeria demonstrate that committed leadership can enable\nwomen’s advancement even without formal quotas. Ultimately, political will determines whether\ngender reforms translate into real institutional change.\nLeadership and champions on gender equality inside the judiciary are key to set positive role\nmodels\nAdvancing gender equality in the judiciary requires leadership that not only enforces quotas but\nmodels inclusion. In Kenya and Zimbabwe, senior officials’ commitment enabled more women to\nrise, who, once in leadership, became advocates themselves. This reinforcing cycle of support and\nvisibility is essential to institutional transformation.\nThe accountability process will define the success of the outcome expected regarding gender\nsensitive measures at the national level\nThe success of gender-sensitive measures depends not just on policies, but on accountability—\ndriven by both civil society and institutional will. In South Africa, advocacy led to reforms when\nauthorities responded proactively; in Kenya, litigation over quota violations, even when dismissed,\nmaintained pressure and advanced compliance. Meaningful change emerges when external\nscrutiny and internal commitment reinforce each other.\nStrategic Global initiatives 14\nDeveloping innovative approaches for people-centred justice\nAs part of key partnerships supported the GJP budgets address women’s justice needs, with a\nin collaboration with Pathfinders for Peaceful, specific focus on funding for legal aid, specialized\nJust and Inclusive Societies, IDLO, and the Or- courts, and services for survivors of violence—key\nganization for Economic Co-operation and De- pathways for delivering justice to women.

It made a strong case for increased and more effective investment in CIJ\nsystems and helped build momentum for their greater inclusion in justice strategies. The dialogue\nalso highlighted the intersection of CIJ with broader sustainable development goals, particularly\ngender equality, land rights, and environmental justice within the context of climate change.\nStrategic Global initiatives 15\nLessons learned\nIn 2024, global initiatives reaffirmed the importance of grounding gender justice in survivor-cen-\ntred, inclusive, and transformative approaches. Key lessons emerged across legal reform,\ntransitional justice, and feminist legal advocacy. Engagement with parliamentarians and other\npolicy makers through platforms like the Global Summit on Gender Equality in Nationality Laws\nand the 56th Human Rights Council proved effective in advancing legal change. Global con-\nvenings enabled peer learning, while sustained feminist advocacy around the draft treaty on\ncrimes against humanity demonstrated the power of intersectional, long-term engagement to\ndrive systemic reform.\nA critical takeaway was the need for ongoing support to national justice actors—prosecutors,\ninvestigators, and victim lawyers—to strengthen domestic accountability and reduce depen-\ndence on international mechanisms. Inclusive dialogue platforms in Ukraine and Kosovo under-\nscored the value of survivor-led, co-designed reparations processes.

Evidence from Kosovo, Mali, South Sudan, and Ukraine\nunderscored that the most effective interventions are those where survivors are not merely re-\ncipients of services but active participants in accountability, reconciliation, and reform processes.\nA central pillar of this work is strengthening the capacity of national actors including commissions,\nprosecutors, investigators, and civil society organizations—through trauma-informed, gender-sen-\nsitive tools and training to ensure inclusive and effective justice outcomes. In Kosovo and Ukraine,\ninter-agency coordination platforms and survivor support mechanisms enhanced institutional\nresponsiveness and expanded access to redress. In Mali and South Sudan, local ownership,\ntargeted legal reforms, and women’s leadership were vital to embedding gender equality in tran-\nsitional justice and peacebuilding frameworks. The Platform’s engagement has highlighted the\ntransformative role of feminist civil society, legal empowerment initiatives, and digital innovation\nin shaping more inclusive, accountable, and sustainable transitional justice systems.\nLooking forward\nThe Platform will scale support for national strategies that embed gender-responsive reparations,\nstrengthen survivor-led participation, and deepen South–South cooperation.

In emerging areas of UNDP’s Global Programme—such as\nenvironmental justice and business and human rights—it is essential that gender considerations\nare systematically integrated from the design stage to ensure that women are not left behind\nin the development of new legal and policy frameworks. Digital innovations, including chatbots\nand mobile legal services, have shown strong potential to extend justice access especially for\nwomen and girls. However, their effectiveness depends on ensuring they are tailored to the lived\nrealities of marginalized groups. Finally, legal and institutional reforms targeting discriminatory\npractices in Aksakal courts and other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms have reaffirmed\nthe strategic value of engaging informal justice systems for women at local level to access justice.\nThe Platform will strengthen partnerships with community-based justice mechanisms to expand\njustice access for women in rural and underserved areas, while promoting alignment with human\nrights and gender equality standards.\nStrengthening evidence-based learning and knowledge-sharing on gender justice 34\nIn Pakistan, despite legal protections, the jus- Key results identified from this initiative includes:\ntice system reflects gender asymmetries.

Building on work in Senegal, Tanzania,\nand across Latin America and The Caribbean, the Platform will support regional strategies and\ninstitutional partnerships to strengthen trust in justice delivery.\n4 In 2025, the Platform will launch new guidances on people-centred approaches for gender justice\nand Customary and Informal Justice programming, supporting implementation at country level,\nincluding in Armenia, Guatemala and Somaliland. Global events and technical assistance will fur-\nther elevate customary justice as essential to inclusive, accessible systems.\n5 The Platform will scale innovation and thought leadership, producing new tools and learning\nproducts that advance inclusive legal reform. A key priority will be financing for gender justice: in\n2025, Uganda Case Study will be launched, following the 2024 Financing Women’s Justice Needs\nreport, to inform policy and investment strategies. This research will help to shape global inputs\nfor the SDG 16 review at HLPF 2026 and CSW 2026.\n6\nThe Platform will continue to strengthen partnerships with feminist CSOs to ensure that their\nlegacy and advocacy expertise continues to shape national reform and international norm-set-\nting.

Strategic Result\nFramework\nThis section presents the progress and results achieved by the Gender\nJustice Platform in 2024, aggregating results across the contexts supported\nby the Platform vis-à-vis its results frameworks. The Gender Justice Platform\nfalls under a common Outcome on advancing gender equality and increasing\nwomen’s and girls’ access to justice, with three common Objectives that\nfocus on gender-responsive and people-centered justice and security\nservices (Objective 1), women’s meaningful participation in justice and\nsecurity sectors (Objective 2), and shaping the policy discourse on gender\nequality and the rule of law (Objective 3).\nTwo parallel results frameworks exist for the Gen- Following last year’s Strategic Results Frame-\nder Justice Platform, based on agreements with work, several results and achievements in 2024\nthe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government were made possible through joint efforts of the\nof the Netherlands and the Federal Ministry for Dutch and German contributions and are there-\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) fore reflected under both Results Frameworks,\nof Germany, respectively.

The Platform\ninvested in 82 justice institutions to provide people-centred and gender responsive justice ser-\nvices, including 48 formal institutions and 34 informal institutions, so that they become effective,\naccountable, and accessible, particularly to meet the needs of women and girls. With the Gender\nJustice Platform’s support, more than 122,000 people (including over 76,400 women) benefited\nfrom legal awareness and legal representation, bringing justice closer to women and girls in Al-\nbania, Bhutan, Kosovo, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. In addition,\nmore than 125,000 people (among which over 79,477 women and girls) accessed justice services\nthrough legal aid particularly at the local level. The Gender Justice Platform continues to prioritize\nthe urgent needs of survivors of conflict-related sexual violence. To this end, in 2024, the Platform\ntrained or supported over 640 national staff- including investigators, prosecutors and transitional\njustice actors- national staff, in 6 countries and territories on CRSV approaches and legal frame-\nworks, enabling them to better address and respond to the immediate needs of CRSV survivors,\nin collaboration with government institutions and women’s civil society organizations\n2 Objective 2:\nThe Gender Justice Platform actively promoted women’s meaningful participation and\nleadership in the justice and security sectors to ensure that they are responsive to the needs\nof people, especially the most vulnerable women and girls.\nIn 2024, with the support of the Gender Justice Platform, more than 660 women increased their\ncapacity to participate in and deliver justice and security services. 12 justice and security institu-\ntions strengthened their capacity to achieve gender parity in their institutions in over 10 countries,\nas a key step towards delivering gender-responsive services. The Platform made concerted efforts\nto promote the meaningful participation of women and youth in law reform and constitutional re-\nform processes. In 2024, 709 women and youth’s capacities were enhanced to publicly engage\nin constitution-making and law reform processes. In addition, 520 women directly participated in\naccountability and reparations initiatives supported in Colombia, Kenya, Kosovo, Mali, The Philip-\npines, and Ukraine. The GJP developed 10 concrete initiatives with the main objective of expanding\nwomen’s leadership in the justice and security sector.\nResults Framework 38\n3 Objective 3:\nThe Gender Justice Platform has actively contributed to shaping the policy discourse on\ngender equality and the rule of law through innovative, intersectional, evidence-based\nanalytics and learning.\nIn 2024, the Platform developed 20 innovative tools and methodologies that produced lessons\nlearned on gender justice. In addition, the Platform supported more than 36 research, knowledge,\nlearning and policy products on topics including reform of discriminatory laws, gender- respon-\nsive rule of law and transitional justice. To disseminate this learning and enable the exchange of\nknowledge and lessons learned at the national, regional and global levels, the Platform convened\nand participated in 35 multi-stakeholder events in collaboration with many partners, including the\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), United Nations Office on Drugs and\nCrime (UNODC), The Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual\nViolence in Conflict, International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), International Development\nLaw Organization (IDLO) and the Conference of Constitutional Jurisdictions of Africa.\nResults Framework 39\nJoint objective indicators\nObjectives Objective indicators Baseline Results Target Results Reporting notes Data source\nValue & Year 1 Year 2 Year 2 (2024)\nYear (2023) (2024) (2024)\nOutput 1: 1.a.
